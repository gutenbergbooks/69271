<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eace</span> and her blessings were flowing already.
All the same there was a terrible crush at Belgravia.
The congestion of passengers and their luggage
at the terminus of the B. S. W. was enough to
daunt the stoutest heart, but a girl in a sealskin coat
with a skunk collar standing at the bookstall on Platform
Three was  as calm and collected as if the war
was still going on. Outwardly at least she made no
concession to the fact that the Armistice had been
signed three days.</p>

<p>She chose some newspapers and magazines and paid
for them with an air that almost treated money with
the disdain it reserved for literature. Then she moved
towards a figure of sombre dignity standing between
the barrier and herself.</p>

<p>“Come on, Pikey,” she said.</p>

<p>A tall, griffin-like woman, craggy of feature but
almost oppressively respectable, followed her mistress
dourly. The duenna carried a large, queer-shaped,
rather disreputable-looking dressing case whose faded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>purple cover was adorned with a coronet. As their
tickets were franked at the barrier, these ladies were
informed that “All stations beyond Exeter” were up
on the right.</p>

<p>In spite of such clear and explicit instructions, it
was not easy to get to all the stations beyond Exeter.
Platform Three was a maelstrom of almost every
known community. There were Italians and Serbians,
Welshmen and such men, Japanese sailors and turbaned
Hindoos; the personal suite of President
Masaryk; Tommies and poilus; American tars and
doughboys; British and Colonial officers, their kit and
appurtenances; and over and above all these were the
members of the traveling public which in other days
had kept the railways running and had paid the shareholders
their dividends.</p>

<p>A cool head and a firm will were needed to get as
far as the stations beyond Exeter. And these undoubtedly
belonged to the girl in the fur coat. Her
course was slow but it was calm and sure. With rare
fixity of will she pursued it despite the peace that had
come so suddenly upon the world. It was a very
long train, but she was in no hurry nor did she betray
the least anxiety, although somewhere about the middle&mdash;Salisbury
and Devizes only&mdash;she cast a half-glance
back to say to her companion, “I don’t see
<i>our</i> porter, Pikey.”</p>

<p>To utter the word “porter” just then was either
bravado or it was inhuman optimism. But the act
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>of faith was justified by the event, for hardly had the
lady of the fur coat made the remark when a figure
in corduroys almost miraculously emerged from the
welter. Both travelers had a doubt at first as to
whether this rare bird was Trotsky himself or merely
a Sinn Fein delegate to the Peace Conference, so aloof
yet so grim was his manner. But at that moment there
seemed to be no other porter on Platform Three&mdash;it
followed, therefore, that <i>their</i> porter it must be.</p>

<p>It was rather providential perhaps that the porter
had been able to find them, but he was by way of
being a connoisseur in the human female. He had
not been employed at Belgravia for thirty-five years
without learning to sort out the various ranks and
grades of a heterogeneous society. As a matter of
fact, there were only two grades of society for Mr.
Trotsky. One grade was worth while, the other was
not.</p>

<p>The progress of the party up Platform Three to all
the stations beyond Exeter was slow but, like fate, it
was inevitable. They walked through, over and beyond
armed representatives of five continents, nursemaids
with babies and perambulators, not to mention
remarkable women with remarkable dogs, trolleys and
milk cans and piles of luggage, until at last they
reached a compartment not far from the engine. It
was notable for the fact that it was two-thirds empty.
Rugs, umbrellas and minor portmanteaux claimed the
unoccupied seats; those remaining were adorned by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>two distinguished-looking gentlemen who, however,
were reading <i>The Times</i> newspaper with an assiduity
that definitely and finally dissociated them from
Mr. Trotsky and party.</p>

<p>The lady of the fur coat was in the act of opening
her purse at the carriage door when a wild, weak
voice said, excitedly, “Oh, porter, can you find me a
place&mdash;<i>please</i>?”</p>

<p>On instinct Mr. Trotsky disregarded the appeal.
There was frenzy in it; and that fact alone made any
examination of the overburdened, rather hunted little
creature at his elbow unnecessary. Dark fate itself
could not have turned a deafer ear than he.</p>

<p>“People are standing in all the thirds.” The piping,
rather piteous little note grew more insistent.
“I <i>can’t</i> stand all the way to Clavering, St. Mary’s.”</p>

<p>“Not be so full after Reading,” said the laconic
Mr. Trotsky, coldly accepting a substantial tip for
services rendered.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but there’s no place for my luggage.”</p>

<p>As Miss Fur Coat closed her bag she observed that
a rather pretty gray-eyed mouse of a thing bearing a
large wickerwork arrangement in one hand and an
umbrella and a pilgrim basket in the other was standing
at bay. She was literally standing at bay.</p>

<p>“There is room here, I believe.” The air of Miss
Fur Coat was cautious and detached, but not unfriendly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“But this is a first,” said Miss Gray Eyes, “and I
have only a third-class ticket.”</p>

<p>“But if there’s no room?” Miss Fur Coat turned a
gesture of immensely practical calm upon Mr. Trotsky.</p>

<p>“Better get in, I should think.” The servant of
the railway company made the concession to the two
honest half-crowns in his palm. “Inspector’ll be along
in a minute. Talk to him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trotsky, having done his duty to the public,
turned augustly on his heel to make a private and
independent examination of the engine. His advice,
however, in the sight of the third-class passenger,
seemed sound enough to put into practice. Or, perhaps,
it would be more just to say that the other lady put
it in practice for her. Miss Fur Coat was curiously
quiet and unhurried in all her movements. She was
absolutely cool, physically and mentally cool, in spite
of the temperature of Platform Three and the mass of
fur round her neck, whereas poor little Miss Gray
Eyes could hardly breathe in her thin green ulster.
And the slow-moving will of Miss Fur Coat had an
almost dangerous momentum. Before the third class
passenger realized what had happened, she had been
taken charge of.</p>

<p>“Go first, Pikey. Clear a seat for this lady.”</p>

<p>Slightly Olympian if you like, but tremendously effective.
Pikey, who looked fully capable of swallowing
Miss Gray Eyes whole with a single motion of her
large and powerful jaws, entered the carriage, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>calmly and competently transferred a plaid traveling
rug and a leather-handled umbrella from one seat to
the next.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much&mdash;thank you <i>ever</i> so much,”
twittered the lady of the green ulster, at the same time
inadvertently barging the end of the pilgrim basket into
the middle of the middle prices on page eight of the
<i>Times</i> newspaper.</p>

<p>A patient jobber from the oil market, en route to
Croome Lodge for an hour’s golf, looked gently at
the green ulster, looked at it less in anger than in
divine resignation, over the top of his tortoise-shell
pince-nez. One had to rub shoulders with all sorts
of queer people these times! Still the Armistice was
signed and Burmahs were up another half crown.</p>

<p>“This train is already twelve minutes late.” Miss
Fur Coat announced the fact after a glance at almost
the last thing in wrist watches on almost the last thing
in wrists, and then assumed the best seat in the compartment,
the one next the door with the back to the
engine.</p>

<p>The tortoise-shell pince-nez peered over the top of
Court and Society on page six. It looked slowly up
and down Miss Fur Coat and then transferred an expert
gaze to Pikey and the other lady. Before the
head office could register any conclusion on a matter
which really did not call for comment, a message was
received from another department to ask what price
Shells had closed at. And there for the time being the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>incident ended as far as the Oil Market was concerned&mdash;ended
almost before it began. For nothing whatever
had happened, so it really did not amount to an
incident. All the same, something was about to
happen.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Inspector came along to look at the tickets.</p>

<p>“You must either pay excess or change into a
third,” he said firmly at the sight of the third class
ticket.</p>

<p>“But there’s no room,” its owner faltered. It is a
phrase no longer in vogue in the best novels, but the
little lady of the green ulster was of the faltering type.</p>

<p>“Plenty of room presently.” So firm was the Inspector
he might have been Marshal Foch himself.
“Meantime you must find a place somewhere else.”</p>

<p>At this cruel mandate the little lady shivered under
her bright thin garment.</p>

<p>“How much&mdash;how much is there to pay?” It was
mere desperation. There were only a few&mdash;a very few
shillings in her purse. All her available capital had
been put into the green ulster and the new serge suit
she was wearing and a black felt hat with a neat green
ribbon. But to be torn out of that haven of refuge,
to be flung again, bag and baggage, into the maelstrom
of Platform Three&mdash;the thought was paralyzing.</p>

<p>The Inspector condescended to look again at the
third-class ticket. “Clavering St. Mary’s. There’ll
be twenty-one and six-pence excess.”</p>

<p>Miss Gray Eyes wilted visibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t stand here all day,” announced the Inspector.
“This train was due out a quarter of an hour
ago.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” faltered the unlucky passenger.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to come out and find room lower
down.”</p>

<p>At this point a slow, cool, rather cautious voice said
“Inspector.”</p>

<p>“Madam?” It was a decidedly imperative “madam.”</p>

<p>“If there is no room in the third-class compartments
this lady is allowed a seat here, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“There is room&mdash;if she’ll take the trouble to look
for it.”</p>

<p>“She says there isn’t.” If anything the voice of
Miss Fur Coat had grown slower and cooler.</p>

<p>“I say there is.” The Inspector knew he was addressing
a bona fide first-class passenger, all the same
he was terribly inspectorial.</p>

<p>“Well perhaps you’ll find it for her.” The considered
coolness was almost uncanny. “And then, perhaps,
you’ll come back and show her where it is.”</p>

<p>The Inspector was obviously a little stunned by Miss
Fur Coat’s suggestion, but he managed to blurt out,
“And what about the train in the meantime?” Then
he went for Miss Green Ulster with a truculence that
verged on savagery. “Come on, madam. Come on
out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’d move if I were you.” The manner
of the other lady was quite impersonal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, then,”&mdash;the Inspector produced a portentous
looking notebook&mdash;“I must have your name
and address.”</p>

<p>It is quite certain that Miss Gray Eyes would have
yielded to this awful threat of legal proceedings to
follow had it not been for the further intervention of
the good fairy or the evil genius opposite.</p>

<p>“You had better take mine, Inspector.” The voice
was really inimitable. “My father, I believe, is a
director of your company.”</p>

<p>Miss Fur Coat knew that her father was a director
of a railway company. She didn’t know the name of
it, nor did she know the name of the company by
which she was traveling, nor was she a student of
Hegel, or for that matter of any other philosopher, but
there really seemed no reason at that moment why they
should not be one and the same.</p>

<p>The Inspector turned to confront the occupant of
the corner seat. It would be an abuse of language to
say that he turned deferentially, but somehow his notebook
and pencil certainly looked a shade less truculent.</p>

<p>“I had better give you a card.” It was almost the
voice of a dreamer, yet the dry precision was really
inimitable. “Pikey,”&mdash;she addressed the lady opposite&mdash;“you
have some cards?”</p>

<p>The duenna opened the queer-shaped dressing bag
with an air of stern disapproval. At the top was a
small leather case which she handed to her mistress.</p>

<p>“Inspector, this is my mother’s card. My father is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>Lord Carabbas. That is <i>my</i> name”&mdash;a neatly gloved
finger indicated the middle&mdash;“Lady Elfreda Catkin.”
She pronounced the name very slowly and distinctly
and with a care that seemed to give it really remarkable
importance.</p>

<p>The Inspector glanced at the card. Then he glanced
at Lady Elfreda. He made no comment. All the
same a subtle change came over him. It was hard to
define, but it seemed to soften, almost to humanize
him. Finally it culminated in an abrupt withdrawal
from the compartment with a slight raising of the
hat.</p>

<p>Before the train started, which in the course of
the next three minutes it reluctantly did, the guard
came and locked the carriage door.</p>

<p>England ranks as a democratic country, but the fact
that a daughter of the Marquis of Carabbas was sitting
in the left-hand corner, with her back to the
engine, lent somehow a quality to the atmosphere of
the compartment which would hardly have been there
had its locale been the rolling stock of the Tahiti Great
Western or the Timbuctoo Grand Trunk. At any rate
two diligent students of <i>The Times</i> newspaper peered
solemnly at each other over the top of their favorite
journal. Both lived in Eaton Place, they had belonged
for years to the same clubs, they were known to each
other perfectly well by sight but they jobbed in different
markets; therefore they had yet to speak their
first word to each other&mdash;for no better reason than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>that he who spoke first would have to make some little
sacrifice of personal dignity in order to do so.</p>

<p>Now, of course, was not the moment to break the
habit of years, but if their solemn eyes meant anything
their minds held but a single thought. Carabbas himself
did not cut much ice in the City, but if he was
joining the board of the B. S. W. it meant that the
astute Angora connection was coming into Home
Rails, in which case purely as a matter of academic
interest, there would be no harm in turning to page
fifteen in order to look at the price of B. S. W. First
Preferred Stock.</p>

<p>That was all the incident meant to these Olympians,
just that and nothing more. But for the little lady of
the green ulster it was of wholly different portent.
When shortly after nine o’clock that morning she had
left the home of her fathers in the modest suburb of
Laxton she had not dreamt that before midday she
would find herself under the personal protection of
the daughter of a marquis. It was her good fortune
to be living in the golden age of democracy, but...!</p>

<p>She stole a covert glance at the fur coat opposite.
Such a garment in itself was no longer a mark of caste,
but this was rather a special affair, a sealskin with a
skunk collar, so simple, so unpretending that it needed
almost the glance of an expert to tell that it had cost
a great deal of money. Then she glanced at the hat
above it, a plain black velour with a twist of skunk
round it, then down at the neat&mdash;the adorably neat!&mdash;shoes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and then very shyly up again to their wearer.
But their wearer was holding the <i>Society Pictorial</i> in
front of her, and in the opinion of the third class
passenger it was, perhaps, just as well that she was.
Otherwise she could hardly have failed to read what
was passing in the mind of the Lady of Laxton.
She must have seen something of the envy and the awe,
of the eager, the too-eager interest which all the care
in the world could not veil.</p>

<p>Miss Gray Eyes knew and felt she was a little snob,
a mean and rather vulgar little snob in the presence of
Miss Puss-in-the-Corner, the tip of whose decisive chin
was just visible between her paper and her rich fur
collar.</p>

<p>What must it feel like to be the daughter of a
marquis? A crude and silly inner self put the question.
A daughter of a marquis is just like anybody
else’s daughter&mdash;the answer came pat, but somehow
at that moment the third class passenger was unable
to accept it. A gulf yawned between herself and the
girl opposite. They were of an age; their heights and
their proportions were nearly identical; at a first glance
they might almost have passed for sisters except that
Miss Gray Eyes was quite sure in her heart that she
was the prettier; all the same there was a world of
difference in the way they looked at life and a whole
cosmos in the way life looked at them.</p>

<p>The little lady sighed at her thoughts&mdash;they were
hard thoughts&mdash;and opened her pilgrim basket. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>took from it a notebook and pencil and a dog-eared
copy of <i>The Patrician</i>, the famous novel of Mr. John
Galsworthy, which bore the imprint of the Laxton
Cube Library. For two years past she had prescribed
for herself a course of the best modern English fiction.
She was reading it diligently, less for relaxation and
human enjoyment than for purposes of self improvement.
Her social opportunities had been few and narrow,
although her parents had rather ambitiously given
her an education excellent of its kind at the Laxton
High School for Young Ladies, which she had been
able to supplement by passing the Oxford Preliminary
Examination.</p>

<p>For the second time in her life of twenty years Miss
Cass&mdash;she was known to her friends as Girlie Cass&mdash;had
taken a situation as a nursery governess. She had
had one brief experience which had been terminated
by her mother’s illness and death. Since then she had
been three months a government clerk, but she was
not quick at figures and she couldn’t write shorthand.
Life as a nursery governess was not going to be a bed
of roses for one as shy and sensitive as herself, but
she was genuinely fond of young children and somehow
such a career with all its thorns seemed more
suited to one of her disposition than a stand-up fight
in the peace that was coming with terribly efficient
competitors, who, if they happened to want your particular
piece of cake, would have no scruples about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>knocking you down and trampling upon your prostrate
body in order to get it.</p>

<p>If Miss Cass had any taint of vanity it was centered
in the fact that she was by way of being a high-brow.
She was not a high-brow of the breed that looks and
dresses and acts and thinks the part. In her case it
was more a secret sin than anything and it took the
form of competing week by week in the literary competition
of the <i>Saturday Sentinel</i>, under the “nom de
plume” of Vera.</p>

<p>The subject this week was the “Influence of Mr.
John Galsworthy upon the English Novel.” It was,
perhaps, a little advanced for the Laxton Cube Library,
but Vera was ambitious. She had not yet won a prize,
truth to tell she had not even been in sight of one, but
three weeks ago her essay on <i>Jane Eyre</i> had been commended
as showing insight. She had not yet got over
her excitement at receiving a compliment which in her
heart she felt she fully merited. If she plumed herself
upon anything it was upon her insight. One day
when she had learned a little more about life&mdash;her
trouble was that she had so little invention&mdash;she might
even try to write a novel herself. But in her case it
would have to be based on first-hand experience. She
would not be able, like the Brontë Sisters, to weave a
romance out of her inner consciousness.</p>

<p>“The Influence of Mr. John Galsworthy upon the
English Novel.” Miss Cass had the bad habit of sucking
her pencil, but it was not easy to marshal or to set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>down one’s thoughts with the train converging upon
Reading at forty miles an hour. However, she was
able to write the heading quite legibly. But then her
difficulties began. What exactly was the influence of
Mr. John Galsworthy upon the English novel?</p>

<p>“Pikey.” It was almost the nicest voice Miss Gray
Eyes had ever heard, yet curiously low and penetrating
in quality. “Do you recognize that?” Miss Fur Coat
folded back a page of her paper to display a photograph
of a famous beauty. “Rather flattering, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p>Pikey lowered <i>The Queen</i>, which she had been studying
with a kind of latent ferocity, and exchanged
periodicals without comment. She was evidently a
creature of very few words, and to judge by a certain
morose dignity it seemed to argue considerable hardihood
on the part of anyone to address her at all
familiarly.</p>

<p>Miss Cass could not help wondering what the status
was of this duenna who seemed a cross between a
lady’s maid and a werewolf. But the chain of her
reflections was interrupted by the stopping of the train
at a station of which she could not see the name. Here
the two gentlemen got out, after one of them had lowered
the window and had called to an official to unlock
the door. And in the order of their going the student
of <i>The Patrician</i> noticed that while neither of them
showed any particular concern for the green ulster,
both were very careful not to tread upon the fur coat.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> three ladies now had the carriage to themselves.
As soon as the train had moved out of
the station, Lady Elfreda discarded <i>The Queen</i> and
said, “What have you brought for luncheon, Pikey?”</p>

<p>The <i>Society Pictorial</i> was laid aside while Pikey
came resolutely to grips with an interesting looking
case which had been placed on a vacant seat. In the
meantime the blessed word “luncheon” had brought a
pang to the heart of Miss Cass. On leaving her home
that morning it had been her intention to procure some
food en route. Alas, the difficulties of metropolitan
travel, the irregularity of ’bus and train culminating
in a bear fight at Belgravia, had driven all minor matters
out of a head that was not very strong in practical
affairs. Therefore it was now the part of Miss Gray
Eyes to regard wistfully, from behind her book, the
disclosure of the contents of the luncheon basket. Certainly
it was quite in the tradition of a marquis’
daughter. There was a place for everything and everything
was in its place: delicious looking sandwiches in
neat tins, a cake which for war time could only be
described as royal, and crowning glory and wonder,
a large bottle of wine most artfully packed with glasses
and corkscrew complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Lady Elfreda shed one neat glove with a very businesslike
air and offered the contents of the tins. “Those
are egg, Pikey&mdash;and these are ham, I think.”</p>

<p>The choice of Pikey was ham. The younger lady
inserted a very level row of teeth into the other kind.
“Considerin’,” she remarked with obvious satisfaction,
“that these left Ireland at midnight they have stood
the journey pretty well.”</p>

<p>But the Werewolf was too busy to attempt any form
of conversation.</p>

<p>Behind <i>The Patrician</i>, now rigidly fixed as a barrier,
the mouth of Miss Cass was watering. Within her
was the emotion of sinking which marks the sense of
zero. It was a terribly long journey to Clavering St.
Mary’s. The train was not due in until after four.
If only she had provided herself with a piece of chocolate!
At the next stopping place, perhaps, she might be
able to get something, but it was by no means a certainty,
having regard to the length of the train and
the present time of famine.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Cass was driven clean out of her dismal
reflections. A voice of irresistible charm was addressing
her. “Won’t you have one of these?” Both
tins were offered. “Ham&mdash;and those are egg.”</p>

<p>Miss Cash blushed and hesitated. There was not the
slightest need to do either, but it was her nature to
blush and to hesitate, and there is no appeal from nature.
A pair of eyes, very blue, very clear and only
very slightly ironical looked straight into hers. “Do.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>The voice was extraordinarily kind. “Please!&mdash;won’t
you?”</p>

<p>It would have called for a heart of stone to resist
such an appeal. Besides, there was no need to resist it.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you ever so much.” A small piece of
paper was laid reverently upon <i>The Patrician</i> and a
delicious looking egg sandwich was laid with similar
reverence upon it. Then a white woolen glove was
carefully removed.</p>

<p>The flavor of the sandwich was quite equal to its
appearance. But it was a mere prelude to the repast.
There was a profusion of excellent things, not a vulgar
or ostentatious profusion, but the case had come from
a land flowing with milk and honey. Miss Cass was
firmly required to do her part with both kinds of sandwiches&mdash;dreams
of sandwiches they were!&mdash;alluring
biscuits and rich, almond-studded cake. Above all&mdash;and
to be perfectly frank there would be no story
without it&mdash;she was compelled to drink honest measure
of a generous and full-bodied wine.</p>

<p>The sombre eyes of Pikey glistened when she took
this royal vintage out of its improvised cradle and
held it up to the light. “Herself said it would be
good on the journey,” she announced.</p>

<p>“I know you are clever with corkscrews, Pikey,”
said Lady Elfreda, handing the implement persuasively.</p>

<p>Pikey was very clever indeed with corkscrews if her
present performance was anything to go by.</p>

<p>“Be very ca-re-ful how you pour it out.” Such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>words were superfluous, which Lady Elfreda well
knew; in point of fact, they were a mere concession
to the famous cellar of Castle Carabbas, for Pikey
showed herself a past mistress in the art of decanting
a great wine under trying conditions.</p>

<p>“Clever Pikey!”</p>

<p>Clever enough. The Werewolf had not dwelt from
babyhood at Castle Carabbas and brought up half a
dozen members of the Family without acquiring
knowledge which in some quarters was rated highly.</p>

<p>When she had delicately filled the tumbler to two-thirds
of its capacity she handed it to her mistress with
something of the air of sovereign pontiff. But to
Pikey’s cold disgust that Irresponsible offered it to the
lady of the green ulster. Nay, she did more than offer
it. She pressed it upon the almost too obvious third-class
passenger with a cunning that made resistance
almost impossible.</p>

<p>“Do&mdash;please! You have <i>such</i> a long journey.” The
blue eyes were smiling. “It will do you <i>so</i> much good.”
The tone was charming entreaty.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but!” faltered Miss Cass.</p>

<p>“There is a great deal more than we shall require.
It is quite a large bottle.” That statement was very
true. It was a decidedly large bottle.</p>

<p>The Dragon scowled over the fur clad shoulder of
her mistress, whom she would willingly have slain.
Nevertheless Miss Cass had to yield to <i>force majeure</i>.</p>

<p>“Those plain round biscuits are strongly recommended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
They make an excellent combination”&mdash;clever
old Pikey to have thought of those!&mdash;“You see, there
is any amount&mdash;far more than we shall want.”</p>

<p>Resistance was vain. Miss Gray Eyes accepted a
plain round biscuit and then she drank of the full-bodied
wine from the famous cellar of Castle Carabbas.</p>

<p>“This is for you and me, Pikey.” The Dragon, a
figure of grim disapproval, had charged the one remaining
tumbler. “You must have the first drink.
That is your side of the Atlantic,” Lady Elfreda humorously
drew an imaginary line across the mouth of
the tumbler. “This is my side.”</p>

<p>Pikey drank. But her nose was so long that it
seemed to stretch from Queenstown to Old Point Comfort.</p>

<p>Yes, a great wine, as none knew better than Pikey.
She could not bear to see it wasted on Miss No-Class.
If Pikey’s will had prevailed it would have choked
the lady of the green ulster. What right had she to
be drinking it, much less to be having a tumbler to
herself?</p>

<p>Who knows what imprisoned genius lurked in that
magic bottle from the cellar of Castle Carabbas? Miss
Cass had never had such a meal. A modest repast,
if you like, yet full of a peculiar virtue. Her thoughts
began to fly round, her blood to course quicker; imprisoned
forces were unsealed in her brain; phrases,
ideas began to shape themselves. The moment with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>its pains and its fears began to press less heavily.
Suddenly she became free of a great kingdom that her
dreams had hinted at.</p>

<p>Suppose&mdash;entrancing supposition!&mdash;she were not an
obscure, timid little governess at all, but the daughter
of a marquis. She could have looked the part anyway;
that was to say, had she been privileged to wear the
clothes of the lady opposite she could have made an
equally good showing. Privately she felt that with an
equal chance she would have made a better. At any
rate, if a glass could be depended on, her eyes, which
were her chief asset, a rather curious gray, would have
gone extremely well with that beautiful skunk collar.</p>

<p>Miss Cass grasped her pencil with a confidence she
had never felt before. “The great charm of Mr. Galsworthy’s
novels, which they share with the novels of
Mr. H. G. Bennett and Mr. Arnold Wells&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>... “This is <i>quite</i> a large bottle, Pikey.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Dragon glistened ... as if she
didn’t know the size of the bottle!</p>

<p>... “You must do <i>your</i> share.” The tumbler was
replenished.</p>

<p>That which slept in the royal vintage was known
only to the Genie whose happy task it was to stage
manage this tiny fragment of the human comedy. For
the little Catkin lady, after a second modest recourse
to the glass, also began to sit up and take notice. She,
too, began to look at the world with other eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Suppose one was little Miss Rabbit opposite? How
must the world appear when you wear cheap clothes
and you carry your own luggage and you have all
suburbia upon your eyebrows? Rather nice eyes,
though, by the way. What was the book she was
studying? Part of some very difficult examination
evidently, to judge by the way the poor hunted little
mouse was biting her pencil....</p>

<p>Governess, obviously ... of sorts. What must it
be like to get one’s living as a governess? How must
it seem to be bored and bullied and snubbed by total
strangers for the sake of a few pounds a year? Still
in some ways even that mode of life might offer advantages.
At any rate one might be able to call one’s
soul&mdash;one’s real soul&mdash;one’s own. If you were an obscure
little governess whom nobody cared twopence
about, you could do as you liked in the big things,
even if the small things did as they liked with you.</p>

<p>There must have been a powerful Genius lurking
in that famous bottle, for the ears of Lady Elfreda had
begun to tingle with resentment. She remembered that
she was an unmarried daughter of a cynical father and
a selfish mother. Four of her sisters had been sacrificed
on the altar of money. And if the present journey
into an unknown country meant anything it was her
turn now.</p>

<p>With a pang that was almost agony she searched
for and read again her mother’s letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Castle Carabbas,</p>
<p class="right2">Friday.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Dearest E:</p>

<p>I hope you will have a pleasant time at Clavering St.
Mary’s. The D. says you may find the host and hostess
rather crude, but otherwise very respectable, nice people.
He is on several Boards with your father. You are not
likely to have met any of your fellow guests, but no doubt
you will find them quite agreeable. And in any case you
must bear in mind that you are giving your services for a
noble cause. I hear from Mabel that last week you had quite
a success in “The Duke of Killiecrankie.” The D. says that
if everything else fails you will be able to come out as a
star!!!</p>

<p>By the way, one of the new Peers will be included in the
house party. He is what the D. calls “a Lloyd-George Particular,”
all the same, he says, he is quite a good fellow. He
has made his money rather suddenly, but from what one
hears he is <i>extremely</i> wealthy. And that is something to
bear in mind with things so black over here and the outlook
for land so uncertain.</p>

<p>The only people you are likely to know are our old friends
the Lancelots who live in the neighborhood. Perhaps you
may get out one day to see them.</p>

<p>As you will be among strangers I am sending Pikey to
look after you. And “under the rose” she is bringing a bottle
of the D.’s choicest Chateau Briault as you may be a little
run down after your recent Labors in the cause of charity.
If you are bored with your present task you must remember
that you are giving your services for St. Aidan’s. Much
love,</p>

<p class="right3">Your affectionate mother,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Charlotte Carabbas</span>.</p>

<p>P. S.: The D. says the new Peer has at least £60,000 a
year.</p></div>

<p>A second reading of this letter filled Elfreda with
fury. Somehow it was so typical of her mother; of
the mother who was a curious mixture of kindness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>naïveté and cupidity; of the mother who cared for
them all so much in small things and so little in great
ones. Behind these careless phrases of Lady Carabbas
her youngest daughter read her intentions only too
clearly.</p>

<p>As Elfreda sat back in her corner and turned things
over in her mind a kind of cold rage began to dominate
her. Had she been left any choice in the matter she
would not be going to Clavering St. Mary’s at all. No
one she knew would be there. But she had not been
consulted. Her autocratic father had promised one of
his friends “in the city” that she should go down there
and take part in some private theatricals in aid of a
war charity. For nearly a year now she had been living
in London with a married sister and working for
the V. A. D. at one of the hospitals, but from time to
time she had taken part in various entertainments with
considerable success.</p>

<p>The play in which at decidedly short notice she had
been called upon to enact no less a rôle than that of
the heroine was called “The Lady of Laxton.” It was
the work of an enthusiastic amateur whose chief claim
to distinction, literary or otherwise, was of the kind
that attends the possession of a baronetcy. She was
to be a governess masquerading as a girl of position.
Not only was the part very long and difficult to learn,
but in the opinion of Elfreda it was pointless, silly and
vulgar.</p>

<p>To make matters worse she had yet to meet the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>author of the piece, but he was known to several of
her sisters with whom he was by no means <i>persona
gratissima</i>. However, with a fulsome letter, he had
proudly sent her a copy of the piece to which he evidently
attached considerable value; and at that moment
it was in the traveling bag by her side. Resentfully
she took it out and began to study it again. In her
present frame of mind, made much worse by her
mother’s letter, the task seemed even less congenial
than it had done at first. “I simply <i>can’t</i> act such rubbish”
was the thought that dominated her.</p>

<p>It was surely too bad to force her into such a position.
She dug her teeth into an uncompromising upper
lip. Charity excused everything nowadays, but the
more she examined the situation she was in, the less
she liked it. Beneath the armor of stern self-discipline
with which she faced the world were strong feelings,
and these flamed suddenly forth into violent antipathy.
Surely it was too bad to be let in for a thing of this
kind! And she would be among strangers, with as far
as she knew, not one solitary friend to help her out.</p>

<p>Her eyes with little darts of anger in them strayed
to the girl opposite. Miss Cass was sucking her pencil
again in the process of thought, her gaze was fixed on
vacancy and she was frowning fiercely. Evidently a
very difficult subject she was studying. But, judging
by the color in her cheeks, she was the better for her
meal.</p>

<p>Elfreda was rather inclined to envy this girl. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>could call her soul her own at any rate, even if her
bread and butter depended on the overtaxing of her
brain.</p>

<p>Accidentally their eyes met. The faint, slightly aloof
smile of the one was answered by the other’s honest
blush of gratitude.</p>

<p>“Are you studying trigonometry?” Elfreda had
never studied trigonometry herself, nor did she know
exactly what trigonometry was, but if there was anything
in a name it must be a subject of superhuman
difficulty; and taking as a guide the air of concentration
and the rumpled brows of Miss Green Ulster her
present difficulty could hardly be less than superhuman.</p>

<p>Miss Cass haltingly explained that she was trying to
win a prize in the <i>Saturday Sentinel</i>.</p>

<p>“How amusing! But one has to be very clever to
do that, hasn’t one?”</p>

<p>Miss Cass was afraid that it was so. She had been
trying week by week for nearly a year, but she had
only achieved an honorable mention so far. The topic
served to break the ice, however, and they began to
talk freely. This may have been due to the fact that
both were glowing with a generous wine, for it was
the habit of neither to indulge in promiscuous conversation
with total strangers. But just now, in quite
an odd way, their minds began to march together, in
fact one almost seemed to be the other’s counterpart.</p>

<p>Miss Green Ulster confided that her name was Cass,
that she came from Laxton, that her father, three years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>dead, had been a solicitor, that her mother had been
dead six months, that she was left unprovided for, and
that by the recommendation of Canon Carnaby, the
vicar of the parish, who had been very good to her
mother and herself, she was going as governess to the
two young children of Lieutenant Colonel Everard
Trenchard-Simpson, D. S. O., The Laurels, Clavering
St. Mary’s.</p>

<p>Elfreda was secretly amused by a simplicity which
told so much and concealed so little. All the same she
was oddly attracted by the way this little suburban
laid all her cards on the table. Her hopes, her fears,
her pathetic desire for self improvement, the general
bleakness of her outlook, her cruel sense of loneliness
now that her mother as well as her father was dead,
her poverty, her lack of a really first-class education,
the exposure of all these things verged upon the indecent,
but somehow they called insistently for pity.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Cass! And yet ... Elfreda shivered at
her thoughts ... lucky Miss Cass!</p>

<p>“How thrilling to act ... in public ... on a real
stage ... to a real audience!” The gray eyes looked
quite charming in their awe and their sincerity.</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” The slight drawl with its
tag of fatigue was equally sincere.</p>

<p>“Oh, I should just love it&mdash;that is, I should just love
it if I were <i>you</i>.” The candor <i>was</i> almost indecent,
but a nearly whole tumbler of a great wine was working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
spells. What Miss Cass really meant was that she
would love to be the daughter of a marquis.</p>

<p>Elfreda deplored her taste and sighed for her innocence.
“Think how bored you’d be to learn a long and
stupid part&mdash;so that you were simply word perfect
in it.”</p>

<p>“I should just love it.” Miss Cass grew enthusiastic
at the thought. “If I could also be the daughter of a
marquis” was the major part of that thought, which,
however, she did not put into words. But those fatal
eyes of hers, in which her soul dwelt, put it into words
for her.</p>

<p>Elfreda smiled pityingly. How little she knew!</p>

<p>“By the way, you come from Laxton?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this morning I gave up my rooms there.
So I’ve got no home now.”</p>

<p>“It happens that this stupid play is called ‘The Lady
of Laxton.’”</p>

<p>“There are very few real ladies in Laxton,” said the
student of <i>The Patrician</i> in a burst of candor.</p>

<p>“So one would think if this play is at all true to
life,” rose to the lips of Elfreda, but she did not allow
it to escape.</p>

<p>What she did say was, “The plot of this play is that
a governess and a peer’s daughter arriving at a place
in the country by the same train get mixed up. The
governess goes off with the other girl’s luggage as a
guest to one house and the peer’s daughter finds herself
taken for a governess at the other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“But what a splendid idea!”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” The daughter of the
marquis opened incredulous eyes. “In the first place,
it could never have happened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think it might have happened&mdash;but of course
it would have been found out at once.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, the author gets over that part
rather well. It seems they arranged the matter beforehand
because the peer’s daughter wanted to teach some
snobs a lesson.”</p>

<p>“But it’s splendid!” Miss Cass clapped her hands
with enthusiasm&mdash;the Devil <i>was</i> in the wine. “And,
of course, the son at the smart house proposes to the
governess thinking she’s the peer’s daughter and vice
versa.”</p>

<p>“How <i>were</i> you able to guess that?”</p>

<p>Miss Cass had been able to guess that because the
<i>Saturday Sentinel</i> said she had insight. But modesty,
of course, forbade her to say that to Lady Elfreda,
who was looking at her now with an intentness greater
and more curious than she had ever noticed in any
human countenance.</p>

<p>Of what was she thinking, the daughter of the marquis?
The mind of Miss Cass could not stop to inquire.
For that deep, delicious voice, that seemed to
treat each individual syllable of the English language
as a work of art, was saying: “As a matter of fact, that
is what happens in the play, but it is all so extraordinarily
stupid that one simply loathes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>
<p>The stern critic had suddenly caught the look of pain
in the eyes of the lady opposite. Then it was she realized
that to some minds the situation itself and even
the vulgarly obvious working out of it might not be
intolerable.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> conversation, which was becoming full of
perilous possibilities, was interrupted by the stopping
of the train at Newbury. From her place by the
window Elfreda observed a consequential little man
strutting along the platform in the direction of their
compartment. He was looking for a vacant seat. She
recognized at once by a portrait in the <i>Society Pictorial</i>
now open on her knee, that he was no less a
person than Sir Toby Philpot, the author of the play;
and to judge by the quantity of luggage in charge of
his servant it was not unreasonable to suppose that
he was on his way to the scene of action at Clavering
St. Mary’s.</p>

<p>He looked a harmless little donkey enough, but
among Elfreda’s own friends he had the reputation of
a bounder. It was this fact in the first instance which
may have led her to judge “The Lady of Laxton” so
harshly; at all events the piece could scarcely have been
as bad as she thought it was or it would never have
held together. But at least it went far to account for
the depth of her resentment against her father and
mother who, without giving her any option in the
matter, had so high-handedly let her in for something
she was going to dislike intensely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>A sense of disgust pervaded Elfreda. Really there
was hardly anything about the little man to call for
such an emotion, but it was his misfortune to be the
central figure just now of the world she was hating.</p>

<p>“Pikey!” Her imperiousness was almost savage in
the ear of the Werewolf opposite. “Put your head
out.” Elfreda lowered the window fiercely. “Look
your largest.” She might have been addressing a very
favorite grizzly whom she had been clever enough to
tame. “Let him see you.... Let him really see you.”</p>

<p>As soon as Pikey grew alive to the situation she rose
and thrust forth her head in all its man-hating ruthlessness.
She was only just in time. Sir Toby, having
caught a glimpse already of a decidedly attractive occupant,
was making a bee-line for the carriage door.
But the sight of Pikey, grim as a gargoyle and breathing
latent ferocity, gave pause even to a recently elected
member of the Old Buck House Club. Swollen with
self-importance Sir Toby undoubtedly was, but in
point of inches he was a very small man indeed, and
he was confronted with the jaws of a man-eating tiger
and the nose of a crocodile.</p>

<p>Sir Toby suddenly decided to seek refuge elsewhere.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Elfreda lowered the ample
pages of the <i>Society Pictorial</i>, behind which she had
entrenched herself. “No family should be without you,
Pikey,” she said gratefully.</p>

<p>The train moved on. But somehow the incident
caused Elfreda’s resentment to flame even higher. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>had yet to meet the author of “The Lady of Laxton,”
but she was amazingly quick in taking the measure of
the world at large. In regard to her fellow creatures
her opinions were few, but they were very definite.
A first view of Sir Toby Philpot had convinced her
that his reputation was deserved and that she was
bound to dislike him intensely. It was all very unfair,
no doubt, but she belonged to the sex which, with
all its virtues, will never be able to run a League of
Nations.</p>

<p>Again her eyes strayed across to the student of <i>The
Patrician</i>. Poor Miss Cass ... and yet ... lucky
Miss Cass! Then it was in just that fragment of time
while she gazed at the slow-moving pencil of the “Lady
of Laxton” that a diabolical thought began to take
shape in her mind....</p>

<p>If only....</p>

<p>It would score them off properly....</p>

<p>Above all it would teach a certain Person a lesson....</p>

<p>Elfreda began to hug her wicked thoughts. Fate
itself appeared to be taking some trouble to play into
her hands. Surely a great opportunity was being given
her if only she could rise to the height of it. But even
if that was the case there was still one very vital question
to ask and to answer. Could the girl opposite be
screwed up to the requisite pitch of nerve and enterprise?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>No sooner had Elfreda put this question to herself
than she did a thing that naught can condone. Deliberately,
of malice prepense, she forced Pikey and Miss
Cass to finish the bottle. As far as the maid was concerned
there was really no obstacle; she was more than
willing to play her part. But Miss Cass needed tact
and firmness; she had to be handled with masterful
delicacy.</p>

<p>“Please&mdash;you <i>will</i> help us&mdash;won’t you?” The voice
of the siren. “Yes&mdash;really&mdash;you must!” The daughter
of the marquis dealt out honest measure with her
own uncompromising hand. “That’s your glass, I
think&mdash;the one at the top&mdash;isn’t it, Pikey?”</p>

<p>Pikey’s grunt was in the affirmative, but if eyes
could have slain, her mistress would have died on the
spot. How dare she offer one of her father’s choicest
vintages to such a middle-class person!</p>

<p>The Lady of Laxton had already fallen at once to
the blandishments of her imperiously charming benefactress.
Her instinct was to resist, but the Bottle Imp
had seriously weakened her resolve. She knew it was
wrong, insane, indecent, but an eye of concentrated
power seemed to bore right through her soul. And,
after all, such wine as that did give one a perfectly
heavenly feeling.</p>

<p>Once more, and almost in spite of herself, Miss Cass
brought her lips warily to the edge of the tumbler.
It was folly, nay, it was piggishness, but at that moment
she was hardly more than a helpless midge caught
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>in the toils of an inexorable will. The wonderful blue
eyes of the girl opposite had the quality of steel.
“Please!... don’t let us waste it ... it is supposed
to be rather good of its kind!”</p>

<p>History, alas, is hardly likely to be very gentle
with the Lady Elfreda!</p>

<p>The bottle was finished at last. And Pikey, who,
after all, had had the lion’s share of it, sat back on
her cushions in a state of most agreeable somnolence.
As for Miss Cass, her pencil began to fly across the
paper.</p>

<p>“Mr. John Galsworthy in common with Mr. Arnold
Bells and Mr. H. G. Wennett has a singular power
of visualizing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Has the power of visualizing!</p>

<p>“What Mr. James Henry so beautifully calls the
Human Scene.” The fair phrase came clear and pat,
but before the page could receive it Miss Cass was
again in the toils of the incarnate demon opposite.</p>

<p>“Suppose you take my part in the ‘Lady of Laxton’?”
There was a suggestion for one simply athirst
for life, for knowledge, for first-hand experience! Such
amazing words could hardly be meant seriously; nevertheless
there was a concentration in the manner of the
marquis’ daughter that almost took away the breath
of Miss Cass.</p>

<p>Emboldened by an unmistakable snore from the gently
but firmly sleeping Pikey, said the wicked Elfreda,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>“I don’t think you would find it at all difficult and it
might amuse you.”</p>

<p>Miss Cass could hardly believe her ears. For the
tone, beyond the shadow of a doubt, was quite serious.
“I don’t know any one at Clavering Park and I don’t
suppose any one knows you.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;” pleaded Miss Cass.</p>

<p>Elfreda was not in a mood for “buts.” The wicked
Genie now had her firmly in its grip. So simple, yet
so radiant was the idea that already it was glowing
with the colors of destiny. There were obstacles, of
course, but a dynamic will could remove them.</p>

<p>“In size we are much of a muchness, aren’t we? So
you can take my things and I’ll take yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but&mdash;&mdash;” faltered Miss Cass.</p>

<p>“You might have quite an amusing fortnight”&mdash;Pikey,
who had been traveling all through the long
night was sleeping very comfortably now&mdash;“One hears
the place will be full of new people. With a bit of luck
... if you really play up ... you might even....”
... Get one of them to marry you!&mdash;was the thought
in the mind of the abandoned Elfreda. But the Bottle
Imp had not quite bereft her of a sense of shame,
therefore she did not complete her sentence by mere
words. She had recourse to wireless telegraphy, which,
however, was just as effective.</p>

<p>Miss Cass felt herself to be growing dizzy.</p>

<p>“That’s what happens in the play, you know. The
son of the house falls in love with the governess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>
<p>“Oh&mdash;but,” gasped Miss Cass. And yet if the truth
must be told the wicked Genie was now beginning to
stir in her, also. A voice was heard in the subliminal
self of Miss Cass. <i>There is a tide in the affairs of men
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.</i></p>

<p>“It needs a little pluck, of course.” The light in the
blue eyes was almost sinister. “But it might be rather
amusing, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>Miss Cass was bewildered. But it seemed to come
upon her all at once that she was now in the toils of
a female Napoleon. Moreover, she was faced by a
proposition which exceeded her wildest dreams. Of
course, it would not bear any sort of analysis, but when
one is possessed by a perfectly heavenly feeling all
things seem possible. Such a sense of “uplift” was
quite new in Miss Cass’s experience and she felt
unable just now to adjust her mind to a phase which
although delicious was yet without a parallel.</p>

<p>The train sped on through a country which grew
steadily richer and more pastoral. Lady Elfreda looked
again at the watch on her wrist. It was after three.
Already the light of the brief November day had begun
to wane. Pikey was snoring now with slow, deep,
reassuring regularity. Somehow all things, even the
motions of the train itself, seemed to be conspiring to
fix and determine the mad project which had been born
in that wicked and rebellious mind.</p>

<p>Every mile that brought them nearer to their journey’s
end was carefully registered in the acute brain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>of Elfreda. The train stopped at Yeovil and there was
a further examination of the tickets, not by a truculent
male inspector on this occasion, but by a rustic maid
in spectacles, who willingly accepted the assurance that
the ticket of Miss Cass was quite in order. After that
the train passed over the borders of Wessex into the
famed county of Devon; and then with but a few embers
of daylight remaining the Evil Genius suddenly
insisted that the time had come for action.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ady Elfreda</span> gave Pikey a shrewd glance to
make sure that the snores were <i>bona fide</i>. Then
she got up and with perfectly amazing <i>sang froid</i> took
off her fur coat.</p>

<p>“Give me your ulster, please.” Napoleon&mdash;Bismarck&mdash;Caesar&mdash;Hannibal
were in that pregnant whisper.</p>

<p>The pencil dropped from the trembling fingers of
Miss Cass. Her heart took a great leap. Was this a
serious demand? Could this amazing girl mean what
her words implied?</p>

<p>“Your hat as well, please.”</p>

<p>In the growing dusk, now as ever a true friend of
conspiracy, she saw the girl opposite withdraw a couple
of pins and remove her hat. Was it conceivable that
she was in earnest!</p>

<p>The urgency of the whisper laid that doubt at rest.
A thrill quickened the soul of Girlie Cass. Her bewildered
mind began to spin with a new and strange
idea. It was madness ... it was lunacy ... and
yet ... if only ... one could screw up one’s courage....</p>

<p>“You will have Mrs. Pike to look after you. She is
very experienced. If you hold your tongue you can’t
go wrong.” Incredible words, incredible girl, incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
proposition! “You will have all my clothes, of
course. I will see that my trunks are put in the luggage
cart. And”&mdash;the whisper was dæmonic&mdash;“Mrs.
Pike has some money.”</p>

<p>Girlie Cass could hardly breathe for excitement. <i>The
Patrician</i> followed the pencil on to the floor. “There
is a tide, etc.” Her heart began to hit her ribs violently.</p>

<p>“Give me your ulster, please.”</p>

<p>If only one’s head would not spin so!</p>

<p>“You’ll find this coat warmer and it’s very comfortable.
It’ll be quite an amusing fortnight. Nobody
will know&mdash;except Mrs. Pike, of course, who can be
trusted implicitly. I quite think you’ll like it.”</p>

<p>The brain of Miss Cass was whirling helplessly. And
yet there was a demon in hers also. What an opportunity,
what a golden opportunity for first-hand experience!
What a chance to see the great world from
the inside. To be, for one whole fortnight, a real
authentic daughter of a marquis ... if only one had
courage!</p>

<p>Miss Cass never really knew how it happened, but a
mile or so farther on she awoke to the momentous fact
that she was wearing a sealskin coat with a skunk collar
and a velour hat with a twist of skunk round it,
while immediately opposite was a girl in a green ulster
with a hat also trimmed with green.</p>

<p>“Please give me your ticket. This is mine.”</p>

<p>By the aid of some power not herself Miss Cass exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
tickets with the Force that was luring her to
glory and destruction.</p>

<p>Finally, as an afterthought, a typewritten abstract
of “The Lady of Laxton” was handed to Miss Cass.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t forget your part in the play. For any
one with a good memory it will be quite easy to learn.
And you’ll find the acting rather fun, I think.”</p>

<p>Miss Cass was living in a dream which could not
envisage details, but she submitted to the play being
pressed into her hand. Without so much as a glance
at the brown paper cover she placed it mechanically in
the pocket of the fur coat.</p>

<p>The next thing to happen in the bewildered consciousness
of Miss Cass was the stopping of the train.
Lady Elfreda let down the window to disclose a
lighted station lamp with the name “Clavering St.
Mary’s” painted thereon. Somehow at the moment
this legend meant nothing to Miss Cass; the land she
was living in now was east of the sun, west of the
moon. But a voice amazingly dominant said:
“Here we are. Pikey, wake up.” And then the owner
of the voice put her head out of the window and summoned
a porter.</p>

<p>A leisurely functionary came up to the carriage door
and opened it. As he did so the lady of the green
ulster said with an air of quiet competence which in
the circumstances was almost uncanny, “There are two
trunks in the luggage van. Or is it three, Pikey? Do
wake up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Pikey somnolently grunted the word “three” and
then with a supreme effort stepped, or rather lurched,
out onto the platform, while the porter collected the
flotsam of the compartment and bore them to an adjacent
trolley.</p>

<p>“Three trunks in the luggage van, porter.”</p>

<p>“Very good, miss.</p>

<p>“They are labeled ‘Clavering Park’&mdash;aren’t they,
Pikey?”</p>

<p>The reply was a drowsy affirmative.</p>

<p>“You have one, too, haven’t you?” said Elfreda in
a bold aside, with one eye upon her maid.</p>

<p>Girlie confessed a small tin one labeled “Cass.”</p>

<p>“Very good, miss,” said the porter again.</p>

<p>The Lady of the Green Ulster stepped with calm
audacity onto the platform. In a kind of trance Miss
Fur Coat followed her.</p>

<p>The porter had no difficulty in retrieving three important
looking trunks from the luggage van. Nor did
the small tin one present any obstacle. When all the
luggage had been duly collected, Elfreda marshaled
Pikey and Miss Cass through the booking office and
past the ticket collector into the station yard.</p>

<p>Several vehicles were waiting. Foremost of these
was a stylish motor omnibus. Elfreda instinctively
made a bee-line for it.</p>

<p>“Are you from Clavering Park?” she said to the
smart footman with a wound stripe on his sleeve who
stood by the open door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>The man said that he was from Clavering Park,
whereon Miss Green Ulster pointed to the Fur Coat
and informed him that its occupant was Lady Elfreda
Catkin; whereon she was informed that there was a
cart for the luggage, but owing to the shortage of
petrol there was only the omnibus for everybody.</p>

<p>Miss Fur Coat, standing helpless and mazed in her
borrowed plumes beside the omnibus door was hustled,
literally hustled, into the interior of the vehicle, and
Pikey, still far too drowsy even to begin to grapple
with the situation in its strange complexity, was hustled
in after her. While the porter put in rugs and
umbrellas and a couple of the smaller cases under the
competent direction of the lady who stood by the door
of the omnibus, Pikey at the same time was adjured by
her mistress in a stern whisper to play the game, to
hold her tongue, and not to give anything away.</p>

<p>These instructions were Greek to the unfortunate
Pikey in her present extremely somnolent condition.
She made one feeble, rather despairing effort to come
to grips with a matter that was frankly beyond her,
but before she could rouse her will to any real activity
the footman had been ordered to start.</p>

<p>“I am to wait, ma’am, for another guest.”</p>

<p>Elfreda bit her lip sharply. For the moment she
had forgotten the existence of the little baronet. Almost
immediately, however, she received a forcible
reminder of it. Sir Toby, who had traveled lower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>down the long train, was to be seen emerging from
the booking office.</p>

<p>For the last time Elfreda thrust her head into the
omnibus interior. “Mind you play up, Pikey. I will
write to you in a day or two.”</p>

<p>Poor bewildered Pikey was only able to emit a grunt
of hopeless defeat before Sir Toby Philpot, in the company
of his faithful body servant, Mr. O’Toole, converged
upon the omnibus door. After a brief exchange
of remarks with the tall footman who stood thereby,
the small baronet took his seat gracefully beside the
lady of the fur coat, and Mr. O’Toole hoisted his respectful
bulk alongside Pikey, who was already verging
once more upon the comatose.</p>

<p>At the same moment Elfreda felt in the very marrow
of her wicked bones that the tremendous risk she was
taking must end all too soon in disaster. But she was
still in the thrall of the demon. The fun would be
gorgeous while it lasted; it would enable certain people
to realize that the times had changed; moreover, having
definitely burnt her boats, this was not a moment
for human weakness. Therefore she said in the private
ear of the tall footman, “Don’t wait for me. I am not
coming with you.” And then she turned discreetly
away from the door of the omnibus, saw the right
trunks put into the luggage cart and accompanied the
porter with the modest residue to a dogcart twenty
yards away.</p>

<p>Brief colloquy with a bewhiskered Jehu in a faded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>snuff-colored livery and a battered furry topper proved
this vehicle to be from The Laurels and that it was
awaiting the arrival of the London train.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson?”</p>

<p>Jehu, who combined the functions of groom, gardener
and general factotum, said gruffly that he was
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson and that Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
hoped they would be able to squeeze the box
of the new governess into the back of the cart without
chipping the fresh paint. It took but a minute or two
for the porter to dispose of the very modest luggage
labeled “Cass” and to accept for his general services
a fee considerably in excess of what he had reason to
expect; and then the groom-gardener, one John Small
by name, said curtly, “Jump in, miss. We can’t keep
this ’orse standin’ here all night.”</p>

<p>Without showing the slightest intention to obey the
order, the new governess looked at the horse in critical
fashion. “I hope,” she said impersonally, “he won’t
take it into his head to sit down.”</p>

<p>The reply, although sweetly given, did not make at
all a favorable impression on Mr. Small, who was a
great autocrat within his sphere; the porter, however,
his heart warmed by half a crown, smiled broadly. The
horse pawed impatiently and Mr. Small coughed in a
hostile manner, but nothing would induce the new governess
to ascend to the vacant seat by his side until the
Clavering Park omnibus had actually quitted the station
yard.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the process of time the omnibus started for Clavering
Park, and in almost the same instant a darker
thrall was cast upon the soul of Pikey. Right up till
that final moment the maid struggling with might
and main against honorable fatigue, the Genius of the
Bottle and the weight of five and sixty years, had
cherished the hope that her mistress&mdash;who apparently
had changed her clothes, although Pikey was hardly
prepared to swear to the fact&mdash;would come aboard
the omnibus. But the vehicle started without that
consummation coming to pass.</p>

<p>Even then the duenna, no longer able to keep her
eyes open, still pinned her faith to the bare chance that
her wayward charge&mdash;the Little Wretch had always
given more trouble than all the rest together!&mdash;was up
in front beside the chauffeur. The old woman knew
that such a conjecture belonged to the region of fantasy,
yet it might be so. Elfreda was as full of tricks
as a monkey and always had been.</p>

<p>The omnibus passed a lamp at the entrance to the
station yard and, as Pikey’s eyes flickered open for the
last time, she caught a hazy glimpse of the fur coat
and the velour hat opposite. The maid drew a long
sigh of relief. Why, there she was, after all! Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
or somebody was playing tricks, though. Pikey
could have taken an oath that five minutes ago her
mistress was standing outside the door in a green ulster.
But the delicious sensation of warmth, comfort
and extreme somnolence was too much for her now.
Yes ... of course ... it must be quite all right.
Elfreda was seated opposite. Besides ... what did it
matter?... what did anything ... mat ... ter ...?</p>

<p>In a measure these feelings were shared by Miss
Cass. She, it is true, was very far from somnolence
just now. Her state bordered upon ecstasy. The
Genius of the Bottle and the many famous novels she
had read must share the responsibility for her frame
of mind. Was she not fully launched now upon the
most wonderful, amazing, wholly preposterous adventure!
She was a living romance and it was equal to
anything in the “New Arabian Nights.” Was she
really awake? Or did she dream? In the humid interior
of the smooth-gliding bus she too was lulled
into false security by a delicious sense of comfort. The
wheels were going round in her head with an ease, an
abandon she had not experienced before. Yet over
and beyond all else was the feeling that as she was
under the personal ægis of a marquis’ daughter everything
was bound to turn out for the best in the best
of all possible worlds. The extraordinarily charming
and clever little Lady Elfreda Catkin, who in every
detail was so absolutely the Real Right Thing, as Mr.
James Henry would have said&mdash;or was it Mr. H. G.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>Wennett?&mdash;whose father was the Marquis of Carabbas,
could be trusted to see to that.</p>

<p>Yes, everything was bound to be all right. There
was a very experienced maid to look after her. She
would have fine clothes and plenty of money; she might
even be provided with jewels. It would all be part of
a delightful joke, a little daring no doubt to a humdrum
bourgeoise mind, but then in High Society they had a
different standard, as all the best writers insisted, from
Thackeray down. And this really was High Society
and she had really entered it. Besides taking the matter
at its lowest, here was a dazzling opportunity for
one who desired to write as well as Mrs. Humphry
Ward or Mrs. Elinor Glyn. The secret door of aristocratic
life had been opened to her so miraculously
that it was enough to make the Brontë Sisters turn
in their green graves with envy.</p>

<p>Girlie Cass was not by nature brave. But as she
snuggled her chin lower amid the delicious warmth of
the skunk collar and she reviewed an incredible situation
to the best of her rather impaired ability, for a
few epic moments she never felt so brave in all her life.
Somehow with that rich fur round her ears and her
very own maid seated opposite she felt almost equal to
anything. Two things only were required of her, according
to her entirely amazing mentor and all powerful
protectress. The first was never to let go of the
fact that she was Lady Elfreda Catkin; the second was
“to play up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Alas, the feeling of courage passed all too soon for
the comfort of Miss Cass. The presence of others
slowly percolated to her. Impressive looking male figures
were seated each side the door. They did not
speak, but this very quality of silence seemed to render
her sense of insecurity greater. And then to her horror
almost the man by her side turned his head and
addressed her.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you Lady Elfreda Catkin? My name is
Philpot. Our hostess wrote to me at Newbury to say
you might be coming by this train.” He was quite a
friendly little man, a chronic sufferer from a rush of
words to the head, who seldom waited for the second
party to any conversation to catch up with his ideas.
Nothing could have served Girlie better at this nerve-racking
moment than the little man’s habit of amiable
loquacity. She was just able to make some kind of
wholly unintelligible murmur, but it sufficed for Sir
Toby to go on. “I sometimes meet your father at the
Buck Club. I do hope you like your part. What do
you think of my big scene in the third act? Monty
Jupp says it is quite equal to anything that Oscar
Wilde ever wrote. I think it better myself, though
that is between ourselves. I wouldn’t say that to
everybody, but it really is a nailin’ good comedy, and
your part of the Little Guv is absolutely the best thing
I’ve done. Of course, it wants playin’ on rather broad
lines, but it’s sure to be a go.”</p>

<p>The little Catkin lady was not very forthcoming.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>Throughout the whole of the baronet’s discourse she
sat in her corner as solemn as a mouse. But Sir Toby
was much encouraged by the passing glimpses of her
an occasional street lamp afforded him. She had absolutely
no conversation, but she was a pretty little
Puss.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a chill of paralysis was settling upon
Miss Cass. She must really make an effort to say
something. It wouldn’t do to appear odd. At that
moment, however, it seemed quite impossible for her
to devise any form of words to meet the occasion.
What ought she to say? What would a daughter of
a marquis say in such circumstances? Above all, the
student of <i>The Patrician</i> asked herself, how would the
daughter of a marquis say whatever she had to say?</p>

<p>Girlie took the line of least resistance. She said
nothing. It was the obvious, in fact, the only possible
course, because her will was inert, her mind was a
blank, her tongue was petrified. Happily Sir Toby
was extraordinarily insensitive, even for a baronet. “I
knew several of your sisters. I am always meetin’ your
father. I hear you absolutely knocked ’em in Yorkshire
as Lady Henrietta in the Duke of Killiecrankie,
but of course this is a very much better play than poor
Bob Marshall could ever have written. Don’t you
think so? But you do, of course.”</p>

<p>No, not exactly forthcoming, but she was a pretty
little thing and obviously very shy.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen you act myself, but Monty Jupp says
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>when he’s coached you a bit more you’ll be able to play
the ingénues out of all the London theatres. He thinks
you ought to go into the business. If your father will
give his consent he will produce a big contract for you;
and if all goes well down here Monty says he can find
the money to put you up as the Little Guv at the Imperial.”</p>

<p>The reserve of Lady Elfreda lasted all the way to
Clavering Park. Happily Sir Toby was less concerned
by it than less gifted people might have been. For he
had a real love of the sound of his own voice, and
somehow it had never sounded better than in this cozy
tête-a-tête with the youngest of the Catkin girls. A
shy little puss, but she was as pretty as pretty.</p>

<p>Under her fur coat, however, Miss Cass had begun
to shiver with dread fear and dire remorse. But emotions
of that sort were simply no use now. Things
had gone much too far. Whatever happened now she
must play up. Therein lay her only hope of salvation.</p>

<p>It seemed as if this journey would never end. The
sense of impending disaster was getting on the nerves
of Miss Cass. Luckily they had not far to go. It was
but a couple of miles or so to Clavering Park.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll</span> the same, Miss Cass was by no means ready
to welcome the end of the journey even when it
came. The first rather abrupt intimation that her destination
had been reached was a brief stopping at the
lodge gates of Clavering Park, followed a few minutes
later by a flare of lights from a large, wide-fronted
house. Then came the epic moment of the tall footman
opening the omnibus door, the descent of her traveling
companions and the obvious need for her own.</p>

<p>Immense courage was called for to quit that comfortable
corner, but with an effort which in the circumstances
seemed superhuman Girlie took the plunge.
After being gracefully assisted from the omnibus by
Sir Toby she moved without apparent impulse or volition
of her own into a wide zone of light. The next
thing she realized was that she had arrived in a large,
bright inner hall that was terrifyingly full of people.
For the most part these were seated on chairs and sofas
in groups of two and three, consuming afternoon tea
and talking at what seemed to be the top of very loud
voices.</p>

<p>A large, fair-haired woman of forty or so, with the
look of a rather overblown yellow chrysanthemum,
suddenly detached herself from the center of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>throng, literally sprang at Miss Cass and welcomed her
with the greatest effusion.</p>

<p>“So nice of you to come! Such a pleasure to see
you! So good of you to come all the way down here!”</p>

<p>Girlie realized that she was in the grip of the voluble
and demonstrative mistress of Clavering Park.</p>

<p>“You have made friends with Sir Toby already, of
course?”</p>

<p>The little man answered brightly that they had
made friends already. Other brief and swift introductions
followed, but Miss Cass made no effort to catch
the names and she shyly avoided the eyes of these
favored ones. And then said the hostess with delightful
urgency, “Do let me give you some tea.”</p>

<p>Almost as if by magic a passage was found to a table
in the middle of the hall. As the important guest
moved forward with the hostess the conversation abruptly
stopped. Girlie felt that every eye was upon
her fur coat, yet somehow the sensation was not unpleasant.
There were more brief introductions en
route. And then at last she was safely anchored in a
very seductive low chair and the conversation had begun
again with a redoubled violence.</p>

<p>“So sporting of you to come and help us!”</p>

<p>Girlie was soon aware that there was no immediate
need for her to say anything; the hostess and those
around her were abundantly equipped with small talk.</p>

<p>“This tea is quite fresh. Milk and sugar?”</p>

<p>Girlie’s tongue declined to act, but somehow she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>able to muster a hoarse whisper which the hostess interpreted
as “Yes, please.”</p>

<p>Tea gave Girlie a little courage. A spasmodic
warmth began to flicker in her gray eyes.</p>

<p>“Do have some more.” The voice was kindness itself.
“And then if you would like to rest a little after
your long and tiresome journey you shall go up to
your room.”</p>

<p>Nothing could have been nicer, easier or more amiable.
For all her excitement, which seemed to be breaking
in burning waves round her head and ears, Girlie
was able to do ample justice to her tea and cake;
she even continued to listen with a kind of gratitude
to the prattle of the yellow chrysanthemum lady, who
was obviously a very good sort.</p>

<p>“We feel quite honored, you know, at having you
here. Sir Toby says you are to be advertised as our
principal star on the play bills. So awfully clever of
you to act in the way you do. I am sure you will be
a great draw. And such a good cause. Do have some
more tea, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The curiously shy and timid Lady Elfreda was not
averse from even a third cup of tea.</p>

<p>“One hears that you are simply wonderful as Lady
Henrietta in the Duke of Killiecrankie. The <i>Society
Pictorial</i> says you have genius, although”&mdash;Girlie suddenly
felt the eyes of the hostess fixed intently upon
her&mdash;“you don’t look much like your photograph. Do
have another piece of tea-cake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>Girlie had never heard prattle sound quite so agreeable.
She began to take very kindly to her surroundings.
At the back of her mind, it was true, the sense
of the unreal was almost grisly. But the immediate
present in which she was living was strangely like a
dream, although touched with sinister edges that might
develop into a nightmare at any moment. Still, a low
cushioned chair, three cups of tea and the eager, the
almost too eager kindness of the hostess were for the
time being an anodyne for the fear that hovered like
doom in the background.</p>

<p>“Dinner is not until a quarter past eight, so that if
you would like a little rest you shall go to your room.”
The yellow chrysanthemum lady glanced half-maternally
at the small peaked face. “If you like, I will
show you the way.”</p>

<p>Girlie was most comfortable as she was, but instinct
told her that it would be wise to end the present phase
of the dream, which was so seductive, and prepare to
envisage some of the stern realities that were undoubtedly
lurking near at hand.</p>

<p>“I think I will please&mdash;if you don’t mind.” Those
were the first words Girlie found the courage to speak
in her capacity of a marquis’ daughter. For an instant
the sound of her own voice, pitched rather higher
than was quite natural, seemed to leave her half paralyzed
with her own audacity.</p>

<p>Happily the hostess, whose name she didn’t know,
was very much a get-things-done sort of lady. “Very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>well, you shall.” She rose from her chair with genial
authority. “You will be all the better for an hour’s rest
after such a trying journey.”</p>

<p>Girlie got up, too. A considerable effort was needed,
but she was able to make it. The mistress of the house
piloted the distinguished guest past tables and chairs,
through the press of people, of whose glances of covert
curiosity she was keenly aware, as far as the staircase
paneled in black oak at the end of the hall. They went
up together side by side, but Girlie was terribly conscious
now at every step she took that she was moving
out of fairyland into a country of extreme peril whose
nature she simply dare not define.</p>

<p>“I hope you will like your room.” The delightfully
kind yellow chrysanthemum lady prattled on all the
way up the stairs. “South aspect, overlooking the park.
We call it the chamber of honor. King Edward used
to sleep in it when he came down here for the races,
although, of course, <i>we</i> hadn’t the place then.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure I shall like it,” Girlie managed to
say, but again in that odd high-pitched voice which
sounded so strange to her own ears.</p>

<p>They turned into a corridor carpeted in blue velvet
and the hostess opened a door at the end of it. She led
the way into the most spaciously beautiful bedroom
Girlie had ever seen. Its size seemed to her quite extraordinary.
It was hung in deep crimson and its furniture
was Louis Seize. A bright wood fire was crackling
on the wide hearth. But, perhaps, what most immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
impressed Miss Cass was the fact that Pikey
was busily unpacking the boxes of her mistress, several
of whose dresses had already been laid out on the bed.</p>

<p>“Here you are, Lady Elfreda.” The voice of the yellow
chrysanthemum lady sounded disconcertingly loud
as they entered the room. “I do hope you will be comfortable.
Your bathroom is through that door. I see
your maid is unpacking your things.” And then to the
kneeling and assiduous Pikey, “Have you all that you
want?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Pikey, looking up for one brief
instant only.</p>

<p>“If there is anything else you’d like you <i>will</i> ask for
it, won’t you?” The hostess bestowed a final benediction
on the most important of her guests. “You will
be able to have a nice rest before dinner. Not until a
quarter past eight ... I think I told you.” With a
last gush of kindliness the yellow chrysanthemum lady
departed, leaving Girlie Cass to deal with a reality that
was rapidly growing stupendous.</p>

<p>For two minutes at least after the hostess had gone
silence reigned in the room. Pikey continued her unpacking,
still wholly absorbed by her task, while Girlie
began to make frantic efforts to emerge completely
from her dream and grapple with a situation that had
suddenly grown altogether beyond her.</p>

<p>There was the authority of the mistress of Clavering
Park that she was Lady Elfreda Catkin, that the bedroom
of the late King Edward had been placed at her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>disposal, and that before her eyes her own maid was
unpacking her boxes. So far, so good. Everything
was for the best in the best of all possible worlds, no
doubt ... but!...!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ikey</span> was still in a rather dazed condition. She
had been traveling all day and most of the previous
night and she was not so young as she once was;
besides, she had not quite shaken off the thrall of
a potent vintage wine. As a matter of fact, she had
not been really awake since Newbury. And it would
seem that the mind can play some decidedly weird
tricks when one is past sixty and one has missed a
whole night’s rest!</p>

<p>For example, Pikey could almost have taken a Bible
oath, so vivid was the impression, that her mistress....</p>

<p>However, that was clearly impossible! A cup of tea
in the severely correct surroundings of the housekeeper’s
room, in which, as the representative of an
old marquisate, she had been at once accorded considerable
prestige, had proved to her quite definitely that
this disorder of mind reflected no sort of credit upon
her.</p>

<p>Her young ladyship had always been a little wild.
And as her guardian knew to her cost, she had given
more trouble, one way and another, than all the rest
of the family together. She might be capable of anything.
At the same time there was surely a limit beyond
which even Elfreda would not go! Strengthened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>by this pious thought, the still rather bewildered Pikey
had proceeded to unpack.</p>

<p>Not feeling either too proud or too sure of herself,
the ancient handmaid went on with her task some little
time longer before she ventured to look up to confront
her young mistress. At last she rose from her knees
and said with a formal air which was a concession to
her sense of responsibility, “I think the blue one, my
lady, for this evening.”</p>

<p>As Pikey spoke she came forward to assist in the
removal of the fur coat. She was a Dragon, but she
was also a first-class servant who knew her place to a
hair’s breadth.</p>

<p>The shock she met with half stunned her. From
between the hat and the skunk collar of her mistress,
a small white face was gazing at her piteously.</p>

<p>There was a silence grim and tense, in which the
hearts of both the parties to it seemed to stop beating.</p>

<p>“Why! ... w-what ... are <i>you</i> ... doing ...
here!” gasped the luckless Pikey at last.</p>

<p>The gray eyes of Girlie filmed ever so lightly with
tears. “I ... I ... Lady Elfreda!” The strangled
whisper was half a sob.</p>

<p>Pikey recoiled with her horrified gaze still on the
hat and coat of her mistress. And then, being by no
means a fool, in one blinding, hideous flash of insight
she saw it all....</p>

<p>The little wretch had surpassed herself! Poor Pikey
grew faint and rather chill. Her charge had played
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>more than one mad prank in her life of twenty years,
but in its daring and its wickedness this exploit was
surely incredible. All the same there was the hard, cold
fact and it had to be faced.</p>

<p>“Why did you let her!” The voice and the look of
the Dragon threatened actual bodily violence to Miss
Cass.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I didn’t seem able to prevent her.”</p>

<p>Reading the gentle, rather scared eyes, the truculent
Pikey felt these feeble words to be literally true. At
the beck of a rather grim sense of humor the old retainer
bared her yellow teeth. It was almost in her
heart to admire the Little Beast; yet at the same moment
she was consumed with a passion to shake the
life out of poor Miss No-Class.</p>

<p>“Where has she gone&mdash;tell me that!” So fierce was
the Werewolf that a look akin to terror entered Girlie’s
eyes. The Lady of Laxton, however, did her best to
give a coherent account of all that had happened.</p>

<p>“You say she has gone to The Laurels,” said Pikey,
blankly. “And she has taken your luggage with her.”
Darkness and eclipse stared the luckless duenna in the
face. “I don’t know where The Laurels is. And, anyway,
I doubt if there would be time to fetch her before
dinner.”</p>

<p>Miss Cass not only doubted if there would be time
to fetch her before dinner; privately she doubted also
if in her present mood the wicked Elfreda would come
if she were fetched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what to do,” groaned Pikey,
“and that’s the truth.” The Deputy looked blankly at
the duenna. Her white face grew piteous.</p>

<p>“Whatever do you suppose is going to happen!”
The cold ferocity again struck terror into the heart of
Girlie Cass.</p>

<p>“L-Lady Elfreda said it would be quite all right,”
she was just able to gasp. “She said there was no one
here who knew her. She said that if”&mdash;gathering herself
for a supreme effort&mdash;“I&mdash;I&mdash;p-played up and
didn’t give myself away it wouldn’t be found out.”
And Miss Cass collapsed against the side of the bed.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be found out!” It was as much as Pikey
could do to keep her hands off the little idiot.</p>

<p>Pikey, however, was not a fool. Already her mind
had shaped the question of questions, What must she
do? She did not forget that she had been sent specially
from Ireland to take charge of one who had always
insisted on going her own way, and if she now
confessed that she had let herself be tricked in such a
preposterous manner she would be severely hauled over
the coals and might even lose the place which she
valued beyond all things in this life. Again, immediately
below the surface of the Dragon’s nature was
the foolish, fond old nurse. Entering the Carabbas
household in early life she had mothered a large family,
first in a subordinate capacity, and then when it came
to Elfreda’s turn, as absolute head of the nursery.
Elfreda in consequence held quite a special place in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>affections. The family of Carabbas was the whole
world and its wife as far as Pikey was concerned; the
rest of the universe didn’t count at all; but the one
who had given her more trouble than all the others together
had been her particular charge. Had it ever
been really necessary, the Werewolf would have gone
to the stake for Elfreda.</p>

<p>If Pikey’s first thought was that she must not give
herself away, the one that pressed it hard was that she
must not give away her favorite. But she was faced
with a situation of fantastic difficulty. It was frankly
beyond her. She didn’t in the least know what to do.</p>

<p>Miss Cass was in similar case, except that somewhere
in her confused mind was a pathetic but sublime
faith in Lady Elfreda. The daughter of the marquis
had solemnly promised with her air of uncanny competence
that everything would turn out right if only her
deputy “played up,” and somehow the bewildered but
secretly flattered Girlie felt bound to believe her. Such
a one as Lady Elfreda must know the ropes perfectly.
And up to this point her mentor had been amazingly
right. Everything had gone almost as merrily as a
marriage bell.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what to do, and that’s a fact,”
said Pikey again.</p>

<p>In the end it was the lady of Laxton who really
took the epic decision. There were several factors in
the case which helped her to do so. Her faith was
sublime, she had succeeded already, she was enormously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
ambitious, such an amazing chance for first-hand
experience could never recur, and when the worst had
been said of her, with all her timidity she was a decidedly
shrewd daughter of a long line of commercial
sires. Besides at the very moment that the issue hung
in the balance her tranced eyes beheld what no pen
could describe: An enchanting shimmer of misty blue,
silver and tulle laid out on the bed. It was such a
dress as one day she might have dreamt of wearing,
yet knowing well that she was never likely to do so.</p>

<p>That glorious confection decided Girlie Cass. She
must play up, she must play up to the very height of
her opportunity. “<i>There is a tide</i>,” etc. Inscrutable fate
had ordained that she was to be the daughter of a marquis.
Come what may she would be the daughter of
a marquis and so prove herself worthy of her destiny.</p>

<p>The little lady, with a courage she knew and felt
was superhuman, took off her coat and hat and then
she said with a steadiness of tone she could not help
admiring in herself, “I think you said the blue one.”</p>

<p>It was quite true that Pikey had said the blue one,
but this audacity rendered her speechless. Certainly it
solved the most pressing of their problems&mdash;for the
time being at least&mdash;but the grim custodian of Family
dignity would dearly have liked to slay Miss No-Class
for her impudence.</p>

<p>How dare that sort of person take so much upon
herself!</p>

<p>The soul of the lady of Laxton, however, had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>fired by the ravishing garment on the bed. And as the
whole situation was poised so delicately that it seemed
to hang upon a thread, the mere fact that she could
muster courage enough for a definite lead sufficed to
determine the course of events. Pikey continued to
gaze at Miss Impudence with sour disfavor, but she
was not slow to realize how small was the option left
to her now. Moreover, it was the will of her mistress.
And at that moment and in those circumstances, with
her own sin of omission so heavy upon her, it would
surely be wise to ensure it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Werewolf eyed Miss No-Class
with a ferocity that was positively frightening. “Sit
down in that chair next the fire so that I can take off
your shoes.” The tone went with the truculent eyes.</p>

<p>Quivering with a secret excitement that was more
than half fear, the deputy daughter of the Marquis of
Carabbas obeyed. Pikey knelt and came savagely to
grips with a tarnished right foot. It seemed to minister
to her inward rage that the shoes of the Deputy
were obviously&mdash;too obviously!&mdash;cheap and that their
heels were shod clumsily with rubber. And as if this
were not enough for the aristocratic soul of Pikey, she
discovered that certain concealed parts of the Deputy’s
stockings had been freely darned. With a sniff of frank
disgust she took up an elegant pair of bedroom slippers
which had been set to warm in front of the fire and
very reluctantly put them on the plebeian feet of Miss
No-Class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>She did put them on, however. Then she rose like
a sibyl, slowly and grimly from her knees, looked Miss
No-Class straight in the eyes and said, “The first thing
for you, my lady, is a bath.”</p>

<p>If a studied and ferocious irony had the power to
slay, the Deputy-daughter of the Marquis of Carabbas
could hardly have survived this first application of her
title. The earnestly intelligent student of <i>The Patrician</i>
flushed to the roots of her hair. Did this Ogress
of a creature mean it for an insult? Did the woman
wish to suggest that one who had been educated at the
Laxton High School for Young Ladies, who had
passed the Oxford Preliminary, who was the daughter
of a solicitor, whose insight into human nature had
been commended by the <i>Saturday Sentinel</i>, had the
woman the effrontery to mean as much as her disgusted
tone implied!</p>

<p>Girlie Cass mustered all her reserves. “I don’t really
think I need a bath.” It was a colorable imitation of
the tone of Miss Pond, the admired head-mistress of
the Laxton High School.</p>

<p>Part of the answer of the Ogress was a snort; the
other part was, “You won’t wear that dress unless
you do have one.”</p>

<p>Miss Cass wisely concluded that it would be unworthy
of human dignity to sustain the argument.
Besides, the Ogress had already produced an entrancing
dressing gown of pink silk. “Put on this,” she said,
ruthlessly, “while I go and get your bath ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Pikey thereupon collected a prince among sponges,
a superb loofah, a <i>recherché</i> cake of scented soap, and
grimly retired to the next apartment, leaving the Deputy,
tingling with excitement yet raging with mortification,
to shed her plebeian garments one by one.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">G</span>lowing</span> from quite the most luxurious bath it
had ever been the lot of Girlie Cass to enjoy, that
little lady presently returned to submit her sensitiveness
to hands of ruthless indelicacy. It had been
Pikey’s pleasing task “to mother” the six small Catkin
ladies. Perhaps the fact may have accounted for much
in her present mode of handling the Deputy. Even
after her charges had emerged from the nursery, within
her own sphere, which was now that of lady’s maid,
she had always been a tremendous autocrat. Her
methods might lack subtlety, but of their effectiveness
there could be no doubt. In the case of the Family,
however, they were mitigated by the knowledge that
they were but the outward expression of her inordinate
pride in and absolute devotion to them all. No matter
what the Catkin ladies suffered at her hands, they
knew in their hearts that Pikey would yield her life
cheerfully for any one of them at a moment’s notice.
The luckless Girlie, however, had not this thought to
sustain her. There was no sense of handmaidenly
altruism to soften the present pain and ignominy of
the lot of Miss No-Class.</p>

<p>One thing there was, however, in this hour of trial
to nerve Lady Elfreda’s deputy; it was the exquisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
garment of misty blue with a shimmer of
silver and tulle. Would it fit? For a moment her
feelings were harrowed by the fear that it might not.
That would be tragedy, indeed. But the fear was
groundless. Nature had molded her so daintily that
even with the thick woolly combinations she had decided
to retain there was room for her small person
in that glorious gown.</p>

<p>She looked in the large glass to satisfy herself that
such was the case, carefully tucked in the edges of the
obtrusive undergarment which so tactlessly showed
themselves above the proud corsage, and then turned
to confront Pikey with a little air of triumph.</p>

<p>“It fits wonderfully, I think.”</p>

<p>Pikey looked Miss No-Class truculently up and
down. Then with a scorn that in a moment less exalted
would have been annihilating, she deliberately plucked
out the concealed edges of the woolly combinations,
sniffed loudly and palpably, plucked at the sleeves of
the gown, pulled them and patted them, and finally
lifted up the skirt. Disdaining comment in mere words,
the maid at once produced a wonderful array of gossamer-like
undergarments, stockings ravishing in blue
silk, and slippers that were a glory of silver buckles
and blue satin.</p>

<p>“Take off that dress.” The Werewolf look came
upon Pikey. “Put on that dressing gown.” The fierce
eyes seemed to threaten murder. “And then I’ll do
your hair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Trembling in spirit, Miss Cass brought herself reluctantly
to submit to this grim ordeal. The Ogress
took an unholy joy in twisting and pulling and punching,
with alternations of savage brushings and combings,
yet through it all was poor Girlie upheld by the
knowledge that not only was her hair abundant, of a
fine color and texture, but it also had a trick of curling
naturally. If it came to a “showdown” she was not
afraid of anybody in the matter of hair. Without
wishing to rate it too highly she had serious doubts
whether the head of Lady Elfreda was so well equipped
by nature, no matter what art may have done for it.
And as a final satisfaction, which present circumstances
seemed much to enhance, it was only the previous
evening that she had shampooed it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Pikey was pitiless, yet she was no mean coiffeuse.
The happy abundance and the charming natural waves
of Miss Cass’s hair offered scope for her skill. And
when she had worked her final will with cruel fingers
and unsparing brush, and had gathered the silken mass
and bound it artfully with a ribbon of blue and silver
threads, the result was a triumph for her and also for
her victim, who had been reduced to the verge of involuntary
tears. As the maid ungraciously surveyed
the fruits of her labors, she had secretly to admit that,
owing to some odd freak on the part of nature, no
head of her lawful charges had ever done her quite
so much credit.</p>

<p>Girlie was then at liberty to devote herself to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>rest of her toilet. But she was not permitted to don
the gauze-like blue silk stockings until the Ogress had
inspected her feet with ominous care.</p>

<p>“I’ll cut those,” was the curt announcement at the
sight of the toenails of Miss Cass.</p>

<p>The proud spirit of a solicitor’s daughter was inclined
to contest the point. She really did not think
her toes were in need of such attention.</p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;you don’t put on <i>them</i>.” The Werewolf
pointed to the blue silk stockings. “And you
don’t put on those neither.” And she pointed to the
enchanting slippers.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Cass had to suffer one more indignity.
Pikey assumed a pair of spectacles, took a pair of
scissors, made Girlie sit on a chair and dealt with her
toes with scrupulous efficiency. The operation duly
performed, Pikey turned her attention to the lovely
gown. A cunning needle took in a bit here, let out a
bit there, emphasized this, diminished that, until at
last she reluctantly muttered, “You ought to do now.”</p>

<p>Girlie, ready to weep for relief, turned again to the
glass. The picture she saw was beyond her most extravagant
hopes. She was&mdash;yes&mdash;she was beautiful!
At the sight of a ravishing self her courage rose. She
had not known that mere clothes and that particular
way of doing the hair and that particular ribbon in it
could mean so much. Somehow the picture in the
glass was going to help her enormously in the part she
had to play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Even Pikey, sunk in savage gloom at the prospect
before her, could not stifle a feeling of half admiration,
which to be sure she did not reveal. It was too much
to hope that the preposterous trick would not be found
out, but at least in the matter of looks, the Family
might have been far less worthily represented. In fact
so clear was Pikey on this point that she opened an
ancient jewel case and took forth an article that lifted
Girlie to the <i>n</i>th degree. It was a necklace of pearls.
This lovely thing had only to clasp a white and slender
throat, of which Girlie had always been secretly vain,
for its owner to be made free of the seventh heaven of
delight.</p>

<p>“That belongs to Lady Carabbas.” Such was Pikey’s
proud concession to the light of rapture in the ignorant
eyes of Miss No-Class. But she did not tell the Deputy,
whose eyes were sparkling with enchantment, that
the necklace was but a copy of a famous original that
was strictly reserved for state occasions. Beauty, however,
is in the eye of the beholder. Girlie was quite
sure that these were the most authentic pearls of the
Orient. When she looked again in the glass she literally
felt their glamour.</p>

<p>Half an hour must pass before Girlie, now slightly
delirious, would have to show herself in the drawing
room. Blood was drumming in her temples already,
an odd kind of singing was in her ears, yet in spite of
the sure and clear knowledge that she was poised on
the very edge of a measureless chasm, in that half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>hour the dominant emotion was not fear. Girlie’s
line of commercial sires were standing by her now; a
certain dour practicality rallied to their daughter’s call.</p>

<p>Moreover, in her way, Girlie Cass was a fighter.
Life for her had never been a bed of roses. And this
was her chance. If only she could control her nerves
and fix her will this perilous game might be worth
while. Besides, whatever happened, she must not give
her friend and benefactress away. Looked at rightly
this was a perfectly gorgeous adventure. If only she
showed pluck she had really very little to lose beyond
her situation at The Laurels&mdash;a heavy penalty no
doubt&mdash;yet over against that was set an opportunity
for priceless first-hand experience, such as hardly one
girl in a million could hope to acquire.</p>

<p>Let her play up and take Courage for her watchword!
Even if she could not fill the rôle of a marquis’s
daughter&mdash;and the event had yet to prove whether she
could or she could not&mdash;the cheval glass opposite told
her quite clearly that very few girls indeed could have
looked the part better.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> clock on the chimneypiece chimed a quarter
past eight, and on Pikey’s advice the Deputy
made her way down to the drawing room. She was
horribly afraid, yet as she caught another view of herself
in a mirror at the top of the stairs, she was not
wholly in the grip of that unworthy emotion. What
a necklace! Its value must be fabulous. As the light
caught it and transmitted its spurious rays, her slender
white throat looked slenderer and whiter than ever before.
Then, too, the flush of rose in the center of each
cheek and the almost unnatural brightness in her eyes
blended with the wonderful frock quite remarkably.
She could not help lingering a moment in front of the
glass, half astonished by her own beauty.</p>

<p>Hearing a sound behind her she moved on. But she
had not gone more than two steps down the stairs
when a very friendly voice said, “Well, Lady Elfreda,
have you begun yet to study your part?”</p>

<p>The author of “The Lady of Laxton,” who was one
of the main causes of the mischief, although both were
far from suspecting the fact, came alongside her in
the middle of the stairs.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t begun yet,” said Girlie in a voice she
could not recognize as belonging to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Sir Toby was rather taken aback by the confession.
The time was short and the part of the little governess
was decidedly a long one. Casual to say the least. So
like these amateurs!</p>

<p>“We begin rehearsals to-morrow,” said the author
gently.</p>

<p>That was not a moment, however, for the Deputy-daughter
of the Marquis of Carabbas to think of rehearsals.
She was within twenty yards of the drawing
room. Would she be able to enter it?</p>

<p>Yes, decidedly casual and inclined to be stand-off,
thought Sir Toby. He hoped the little idiot had not
had her head turned already by success. Sir Toby
glanced at her sideways, fully and expertly taking
her in without any suggestion that he was doing
so. Nailingly pretty, by gad! If her acting was up
to her looks they would have a <i>succès fou</i> on Tuesday
week. Quite a stepper in her way, but apparently very
shy. No doubt she would improve on acquaintance.</p>

<p>Sir Toby’s survey of the little Puss was so eminently
satisfactory that he had no qualms at all about
entering the drawing room with her. Girlie had
many, however, about entering it with him. Still it
would be easier than going in by oneself. She nerved
herself for the severest ordeal of her life. And yet,
after all, it proved quite a simple matter.</p>

<p>“Interesting sight,” proclaimed a bold looking
woman in pink with a marble and platinum voice as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>soon as she appeared in the room with Sir Toby.
“Behold the author and the leading lady.”</p>

<p>In almost the same moment the yellow chrysanthemum
lady who was looking magnificent in black satin
swooped upon her. “Now I must make you known to
everybody. The plain but pompous looking, rather
overdressed man standing over there with his hands in
his pockets, is my husband. Let me introduce you.”</p>

<p>The gentleman in question bowed to Lady Elfreda
who found the presence of mind to offer her hand.
And then as the host, one Richard Minever by name,
a rich and rollicking M. P., took the hand of the little
lady, he grinned at his wife and said, “Confound your
impudence, Kate.”</p>

<p>“This is he with whom you will have to go in,”
said the hostess coolly. “I am very sorry for you
but I am afraid it can’t be helped. But you will have
some one really nice the other side of you. Let me
introduce Lord Duckingfield.”</p>

<p>Lord Duckingfield was a large man of forty-five
with a face that was by no means unattractive. He
was full of geniality and charmingly simple and
natural; his air as he heartily shook Girlie’s hand was
that of a father towards her.</p>

<p>“I often see your papa at our Board meetings,”
said Lord Duckingfield. “He says you are quite the
clever one of the family.” And as his lordship caught
little Miss Grey Eyes broadside on, he felt tempted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>to add although he refrained from doing so, “He
might also have said you were the pretty one.”</p>

<p>They went in to dinner almost at once, the host
offering a paternal arm to Lady Elfreda and showing
the way. The party was not uncomfortably large.
Mr. and Mrs. Minever, two tall and cheerful daughters,
and half a dozen guests who were staying in
the house. But there was an atmosphere of noisy
good humor about it which was very welcome to
Girlie. The banter and the repartee and the jovial
give and take, which if not always in the best of taste,
seemed vastly entertaining to every one concerned, all
helped to provide a most fortunate cloak for the little
lady who sat between the host and Lord Duckingfield.</p>

<p>She was really required to do very little beyond
getting on with an excellent dinner. True, her private
emotions hardly allowed her to do justice to the menu,
but such slight attention was paid to her personally
amid the general clamor that she was almost able to enjoy
herself. All the same she was resolutely careful
not to exceed one glass of champagne. The shrewd
northern forebears simply would not hear of more
than one glass. But in the one she had, there was
magic. It seemed to open her heart to the luxurious
play of civilized life around her. She knew it was a
chimera that could not possibly last, at any moment the
game might be up, but no matter what happened later,
she would be a connoisseur in human experience who
had lived one glorious hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Hoisted upon that high thought, Girlie removed her
lips from the rim of her glass and sat up very straight.
Yes, for that evening at any rate, she would live her
hour; she really would be the daughter of a marquis
even if she had to go to prison for it afterwards. Her
late father, who had been a lawyer himself, always
maintained that the law was the most uncertain thing
in the world; so there really was a prospect of its
coming to that. In the meantime, however, she would
play up for all she was worth if only for the sake
of the amazing new friend who had gone to The
Laurels in her place, and who at this moment must
be bitterly rueing the freak that had led her to forego
this delightful meal.</p>

<p>Not only did Girlie sit up physically, she sat up
mentally. Keeping her eyes and ears open, she began
to take grave and particular notice! Somewhere in
her mind floated vague fragments from <i>Hints on
Etiquette by a Member of the Aristocracy</i>, and for
that reason she boldly discarded her fish-knife, as she
seemed to remember that the best people relied exclusively
on forks for their fish whenever it was possible
to do so. She noted, however, that neither of her
neighbors seemed aware of that fact, and Mr.
Minever and Lord Duckingfield went down a little in
her esteem. But, after all, it merely cast one romantic
light the more on the general situation. These
people might be very amusing and very jolly and very
rich, but even with their titles to help them they could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>hardly be considered real Aristocrats. And it was
because Lady Elfreda Catkin was an aristocrat to
her finger tips that she chose darkness and eclipse
rather than sully her proud soul by mixing with people
who needed fish-knives to grapple with boiled
turbot.</p>

<p>“We are expectin’ great things of you, Lady Elfreda.”
The loud voiced little man opposite was addressing
her personally. “They say you absolutely
knocked ’em in Yorkshire. I hope you’ll like your
part. It was written for you specially.”</p>

<p>“Why, Philpot, you’ve not seen Lady Elfreda act,”
said the host in his rich, rollicking tactless way.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t always necessary,” said the author of “The
Lady of Laxton” stoutly, “to see a woman act in
order to write a part for her. Sardou did it over
and over again. So did Scribe. So has Pin I’m sure&mdash;and
all of ’um.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t sound very convincing, Sir Toby,” said
the voice of the yellow chrysanthemum lady from the
other end of the table, who like her husband could not
claim that tact was her long suit. “But it’ll be all
right on the night no doubt. By the way <i>is</i> there
any one here who <i>has</i> seen Lady Elfreda act?”</p>

<p>Girlie held her breath. The pause which followed
Mrs. Minever’s words seemed so painfully long, so
intensely dramatic. Would it never end? A shiver
crept along the spine of the Deputy. Beneath the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>eyes of the entire table she felt herself to be turning
green.</p>

<p>“What?&mdash;No one!” said the hostess.</p>

<p>No one had apparently.</p>

<p>“That’s a bit of luck for you, Lady Elfreda,” said
the host with his jovial air.</p>

<p>The whole table laughed. Girlie began to breathe
again.</p>

<p>“But Lady Elfreda’s escape is only temporary,” the
hostess announced. “To-morrow Mr. Montagu Jupp
is coming. And he claims to have taught Lady Elfreda
all the acting she knows.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> heart of the Deputy seemed to stop beating
as she heard the sinister words of the hostess.
But again as her lips sought the brim of her glass she
took courage. No matter what to-morrow had in
store she must live this wonderful hour. She would
lose her situation for a certainty, perhaps she would
have to go to prison, but this evening, come what
might, she was determined to yield to a signal experience.</p>

<p>She felt like a flower that expands to the sun. To
be young, to be rich, to be highly born, to be beautifully
dressed, in a word to be the veritable daughter of
a marquis&mdash;what a supreme destiny! Nor was it a
silly and vulgar snobbishness that made her think
so. Such a life as the one she was living now meant
poetry, romance, color, joy. To-morrow she would
return inevitably to what she was; to-morrow the
endless dreary days of governessing would begin
again; but to-night&mdash;to-night she would drink of the
cup!</p>

<p>Nevertheless the shrewd northern forebears insisted
that one glass of champagne must be Girlie’s limit.
But it was not easy to compute the precise measure
with the butler always on the watch to keep it up to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>the brim. Rigidly on guard as she was, a glorious,
devil-may-care sort of feeling stole over her. A flush
crept on her cheek, her soul leapt to her eyes, so that
in the sight of more than one beholder the youngest
of the Catkin girls looked uncommonly pretty.</p>

<p>It was after dinner, however, that the ordeal of
Miss Cass really began. In the drawing room, over
the coffee cups, alone with her own sex, she had to
call out the reserves of her courage. The ladies were
so much more formidable than the gentlemen! Somehow
their manner towards her seemed curiously
quizzical! Their lightest remarks, even their way of
looking at one were singularly embarrassing. Still
Girlie said very little, but smiled a good deal, was
content to answer direct questions with a brief “yes”
or a briefer “no,” so that for the time being she was
able to disarm those whom she felt to be her natural
enemies. Nevertheless the advent of the gentlemen
came as a particular relief.</p>

<p>The return of the gentlemen lessened the tension
considerably. Their black coats and white waistcoats
seemed to add a subtle quality to the <i>mise-en-scène</i>;
somehow they appeared to humanize the atmosphere
of the drawing room. Girlie found them much the
easier to get on with. For one thing the new peer
who was on several Boards with her distinguished
parent, the marquis, quite took her under his wing. It
seemed he had promised Lady Elfreda’s father that
he would look after her. And from the outset it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>clear that the hostess at any rate was anxious that
Lord Duckingfield should be as good as his word.</p>

<p>He was a plain honest midlander, a man almost
wholly without pretensions, and although not exactly
in the first blush of youth Girlie could not help thinking
that he was extremely nice. If she had not known
he was a lord she would never have guessed it. There
was something very straightforward about him, something
very considerate, something very kindly, something
very humane. From the first he paid court to
her in his rather heavy, fatherly way; yet in this
there may have been an ulterior motive, for as he
presently said, he hoped Lady Elfreda would teach
him to jazz.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know how to,” Girlie confessed with
naïve dismay. “I only know the One Step and I am
not at all good at it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to teach me that,” said my lord,
looking straight into the sweetly serious gray eyes.
“Although,” he added with a roguish smile, “I’ve
been told that nowadays you smart young ladies know
everything.”</p>

<p>Exceptions there are to every rule, and in the sight
of Lord Duckingfield the little Catkin lady furnished
one. She seemed to know hardly anything about anything.
But he didn’t complain of that. He was old
fashioned enough to prefer that style of young woman;
the smart modern miss was apt to be too well
informed on every subject. It was really a pleasure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>to meet one quite the reverse; one in fact who was
ready, nay eager, to sit metaphorically at your feet.
My lord in common with most prosperous men of his
age liked the sound of his own voice and this pretty
little girl&mdash;she really was pretty!&mdash;had the subtle art
of making him forget that he was indulging a weakness.
She hung on his words. She laughed at his
stories. When he grew reminiscent, round eyes of
serious wonder rewarded him. Yes, quite a nice little
filly, both docile and intelligent, and not at all inclined
to rate herself too highly, which he had rather
feared would be the case, having regard to the stable
she came out of.</p>

<p>For a full hour Lord Duckingfield was allowed to
monopolize the chief guest. And no one challenged
his right. The hostess had reached the conclusion
already that she was “heavy cake”; the other ladies
were already divided in their minds as to whether
Lady Elfreda was or was not half-witted. She would
improve on acquaintance no doubt, but as Mrs. Spencer-Jobling,
a bold lady in pink, found occasion to
hint to Sir Toby, the immediate outlook for his masterpiece
was not encouraging.</p>

<p>“But they say she can act like blazes you know.”
Sir Toby clung to that belief in the teeth of growing
skepticism. “Monty Jupp says when he’s coached her
a bit more she’ll be quite equal to any of the professionals.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall see,” said Mrs. Spencer-Jobling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>who prided herself on being without illusion on any
subject. “But with Miss Kitwood we should have
been absolutely safe.”</p>

<p>Sir Toby, allowing his eyes to stray to the animated
picture on the distant sofa, was impelled to discount
the pessimism of Mrs. Spencer-Jobling. She was
quite the prettiest little Puss he had seen in a month
of Sundays, and old man Duckingfield, that astute
midlander, evidently thought so too.</p>

<p>When bedtime came for the ladies, Sir Toby contrived
a broad hint for Lady Elfreda as he politely
opened the drawing room door. “I’m afraid you
have a hard day to-morrow,” he said. “Your part
is a long one and there isn’t much time to study it
before the rehearsals begin. So mind you have a
good night’s rest.”</p>

<p>Alas, had it been Sir Toby’s intention to deprive the
little lady of the boon he was so urgently recommending
no words could have been better calculated for
the purpose. They almost ensured a sleepless vigil.
At the prospect before her, Girlie felt one more chill
along her spine. All the same as she went up the
stairs with the other ladies and forced herself by sheer
power of will to give them a gay good-night, the paramount
emotion was triumph. She had come through
a grim ordeal quite brilliantly. No one had appeared
to suspect her, and incredible as the fact might seem,
she had almost enjoyed herself! The morrow, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>true, was dark indeed, but already her life had known
one unforgettable moment.</p>

<p>“Now mind you sleep well, Lady Elfreda.” The
hostess took an effusive leave of her on the threshold
of King Edward’s bedroom. “And no one is expected
to show at breakfast unless they particularly wish to
do so. So we shall not feel offended if you stay in
bed all morning and study your part.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ikey</span>, with a shawl round her shoulders, was
dozing by the bedroom fire. She was awaiting
the Deputy’s return and doing her best to keep awake.
Sleepy as she was, her reception of Miss No-Class
was decidedly rough and yet less rough than might
have been the case had she not been already informed
in the servants’ hall by Mr. Pierce, the butler, that in
the matter of looks her young ladyship could give all
the other ladies points and a beating.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce meant well, but it was a left handed
compliment, that was the best that could be said for
it, yet in a sense Pikey felt rather gratified. The
verdict of Mr. Pierce at any rate implied that Miss
No-Class had borne herself throughout the evening
quite as well as was to have been expected. So far,
apparently, she had not given herself away.</p>

<p>“You will have your breakfast in bed,” said Pikey
grimly.</p>

<p>Flown by success, Miss Cass did her best to bring
a steady eye to bear upon the maid.</p>

<p>“I have already arranged to do so,” she said with
a very fair approximation to the manner of the admired
Miss Pond. She was still in deadly fear of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>the Dragon, but she must neglect no opportunity of
putting her in her place.</p>

<p>“Oh, you have,” said Pikey, more grimly than ever.
The Miss-Pond-manner had left her cold. “And you
may have to stay in bed for luncheon as well.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;” For the moment Girlie was not able to
proceed beyond that ineffective monosyllable. Pikey
was “undoing her at the back” and even this mild
protest earned her a decidedly savage shake.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” Pikey ominously explained. “I’m
going over to The Laurels the first thing in the morning
and it’s the best part of four miles away, so Mrs.
Bletsoe the housekeeper tells me. And you’ve got
to stop in bed till I come back.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;” Miss No-Class protested.</p>

<p>“Let down your hair.” Of a sudden the Werewolf
took a most formidable long-handled brush from the
dressing table for all the world as if it had been a
birch rod.</p>

<p>Miss Cass could not repress a tremor of fear as
she withdrew the pins and the charming ribbon.</p>

<p>“You’ll stay in bed till I return.”</p>

<p>Poor Girlie gave a suppressed howl as the best
quality hogs’ bristle seemed to tear open her scalp.
“And Mrs. Bletsoe doubts whether I’ll be back by
luncheon time if I miss the bus from the Royal Oak
at Clavering.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The long-handled hairbrush began to draw real
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>salt tears. “Don’t you dare to show yourself again
until I’ve seen her young ladyship. To-morrow she’s
coming here.” Suppressed wowl. “Or I’ll know the
reason.” Wowl ad libitum.</p>

<p>The Deputy ventured no more “buts.” She feared
that this old Sioux might cause her scalp to disappear
altogether.</p>

<p>“Do you understand?”</p>

<p>With her hair gathered in one large merciless handful
Girlie understood only too well.</p>

<p>“Now you can get into bed.” It was the tone of
the absolute ruler of the nursery to one who had just
received an honest instalment of her deserts and it
also implied a promise of more to follow.</p>

<p>Girlie felt it was nothing less than an outrage to
treat the daughter of a solicitor in that way; but without
unnecessary delay she slipped in between the sheets
and made the acquaintance of a friendly hot water
bottle.</p>

<p>“Remember, you don’t get up&mdash;until you are told.
And mind you say your prayers.” The Dragon
switched off the electric light and retired to her own
quarters to a chequered night’s repose.</p>

<p>Girlie fared no better. Never in the course of her
life had sleep seemed so far from her pillow. She
grew so excited as the present, the future, and the
immediate past flooded her mind that after a while
she switched on the light. On a shelf by her bedside
were several of her favorite writers, but in this mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
crisis even Miss Cholmondeley, Mr. Galsworthy,
and Mrs. Humphrey Ward were powerless. After
that she tried studying her part, but she could not
bring her mind to bear upon it. Finally, as she paced
up and down the large room, she tried to continue her
essay for the <i>Saturday Sentinel</i>, but none of these
alternatives were of the least use. Her nerves were in
a state of mutiny. She could not think coherently.
The fix she was in grew more terrifying as the hours
passed. There seemed to be no way out. She had
been mad, worse than mad. Her career was irretrievably
ruined. And when the trick was discovered, as
within the next four and twenty hours it was bound
to be, she might very easily find herself in prison.
And yet&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>That “and yet” was the cruel part. Up till now
she had carried the thing off brilliantly. In a manner
of speaking she had quite enjoyed the evening; so
much had she appreciated its charm and its luxury
that it had seemed like coming into one’s own. No
matter what the sequel was, it would ever remain a
golden memory almost capable of making any penalty
worth while.</p>

<p>The dawn had begun already to steal through the
Venetian blinds of King Edward’s bedroom before
Girlie slept at all. All too soon she was aroused by
a maid with a well filled tray. Face to face with the
cold light of day and the naked reality of a perfectly
stupendous present, the Deputy wisely determined that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb;
accordingly with a wrap round her shoulders she sat
up in bed, made a tolerable breakfast and then put
forth one more effort to fix her mind on “The Lady
of Laxton.”</p>

<p>She was engaged in diligent study when Pikey entered
to bestow a final word of admonition upon her
before she set out for The Laurels. In spite of the
fatigues of travel, Pikey, it seemed, had slept almost
as ill as Miss No-Class. They shared an overwhelming
responsibility. But the Deputy, comfortably in
bed, showed herself very docile in the matter of getting
up. She was quite content to stay as she was.
It would suit her very well not to get up until the
ambassadress returned from The Laurels; it would
suit her even better not to get up at all.</p>

<p>The morning was fine and about half-past ten a
gauntly-respectable Pikey set forth a grim figure of
truculent despair. At the outset fortune was with
her. A motor omnibus plied between Clavering and
the neighboring villages, passing the Park gates
every two hours in the process. Armed with sound
advice from the housekeeper’s room, Pikey was able
“to time” this vehicle and thereby to reach the Pendennis
Arms at Clavering in something less than
thirty minutes. Inquiry at that center of information
disclosed the fact that The Laurels was some two
miles away on the outskirts of the town. Colonel
Trenchard-Simpson, it seemed, was a local auctioneer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>whose rank was a mystery and a wonder to the wise.</p>

<p>As no fly or other medium of travel was at hand,
Pikey decided to walk to The Laurels. The house
was not difficult to find, but the two miles proved to
be nearly three, and it took Pikey, not feeling so young
as she used to, the best part of an hour to get there.
It was a rather mediocre dwelling, at any rate in the
eyes of Pikey who had big ideas, standing a little back
from the high road. There was a small plantation in
front of it and there was no other house near, but
Pikey’s first impression was that it didn’t amount to
much; and when the disgruntled visitor opened its
gate which was in need of a coat of paint and her
rather dazed mind was suddenly flooded with a renewed
sense of her mission, this impression was confirmed.</p>

<p>In the stress of a great crisis, Pikey had not paused
en route to consider details of procedure, but now that
she had reached her destination they simply had to be
faced. Should she go up boldly to the front door
and ring the bell? Certainly that seemed to be the
right course to take. But then arose the question, for
whom must she ask if she did so? For Pikey was
now “up against” the fact that she had quite forgotten
the name of Miss No-Class, even if, and it was a
point upon which she was by no means clear, she had
ever known it. However she did not spend much
time in wreaking a vain rage upon herself, for she
realized that by now she was a long way from Clavering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Park, and that circumstances called sternly for
action. Therefore without delay she walked along
the carriage drive and rang the front door bell. The
Laurels was a stucco residence of the glorified suburban
villa type with A. D. 1880 engraved on the stone
lintel.</p>

<p>The summons was answered by a slightly tarnished
parlor-maid in a pink print dress. She was inclined to
be pert and the aristocratic spirit of Pikey rose and
fell in almost the same moment.</p>

<p>“Can I see the governess, please?” said Pikey, breathing
hard. That, after all, was the only formula.</p>

<p>“She’s out with Miss Joan and Master Peter.” The
parlor-maid regarded the visitor with an eye of
frank disfavor.</p>

<p>Pikey’s heart sank. “Which way has she gone?”
she bleakly inquired.</p>

<p>“She’s gone into Clavering to do some shopping for
the mistress.”</p>

<p>Pikey took courage. If she could find out the road
by which Elfreda was likely to return there was a
hope of intercepting her. Happily, as the visitor was
duly informed, the hope was much increased by the
fact that there was only one road into Clavering.</p>

<p>“I wonder how I can have missed her.” Pikey drew
a breath of relief. She offered curt thanks to the
parlor-maid and was about to turn away from the
door, when a sharp voice which was evidently that of
the mistress of the house who had caught from afar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>the deep note of the visitor’s Irish intonation, said,
“Don’t encourage beggars, Jarvis.”</p>

<p>With that insult stirring her blood, poor Pikey
made off down the carriage drive, slammed her way
out of the gate and took the road back to Clavering.
Murder was in her heart, but her spirit was sore, her
soul faint. It was a long way to Clavering Park, and
she had never felt so disgruntled in her life. Indeed,
a few yards on as she crossed a small stone bridge
which spanned a local streamlet and lingered a moment
to look at the water gurgling beneath, for one
weak, wild instant she was almost tempted to try
drowning as a remedy for a coil that grew more tragic
at every thought she gave to it.</p>

<p>A hundred yards ahead was a sharp bend in the
road. Rounding it in a state of utter despair, Pikey
unexpectedly found herself converging upon a young
woman in a green ulster who held a small girl and a
smaller boy by the hand. Accompanying them was
a tall, distinguished looking soldier in much beribanded
khaki, who walked with a slight limp.</p>

<p>Somehow Pikey was not prepared for Elfreda, but
she it was, although more than one glance under the
cheap hat was needed to satisfy the maid that such
was the case. Indeed, Elfreda recognized Pikey before
Pikey recognized her. She was prompt, moreover,
being a very quick-witted young woman, to meet the
situation.</p>

<p>Elfreda’s method of dealing with it was delightfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
simple. She sent on Miss Joan and Master
Peter with the tall warrior in khaki, and then calmly
and sternly she confronted the maid. With a coolness
that literally took away Pikey’s breath she said,
“Why, what in the name of fortune are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>The luckless Pikey had no answer ready. Elfreda’s
sheer impudence was sublime. Pikey could only gasp.</p>

<p>Elfreda calmly watched her charges disappear out
of sight round the corner. Then she fixed the duenna
with a blue eye of concentrated audacity. “Surely
you don’t mean to say they’ve found out?”</p>

<p>Pikey was able to affirm that so far they had not.</p>

<p>“Then what on earth are you doing here?” The
tone put the maid completely in the wrong.</p>

<p>Such a cynical carrying of the war into the country
of the enemy was a little too much for Pikey. But
she was not going to admit defeat. With a snort and
a scowl she declared that she had come to fetch Elfreda
and that no matter what happened it was her
fixed resolve not to return to Clavering Park without
her mistress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII">XIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was now the turn of Elfreda to be taken aback.</p>

<p>“Pikey,” she said, “are you mad?”</p>

<p>The look in the eyes of the duenna rather suggested
that condition. But Elfreda did not yield an inch.
“Are you mad, Pikey?” she repeated sternly.</p>

<p>Before such hardihood the spirit of the Dragon
quailed. So proper and natural would it have been
for Pikey to ask the question that Elfreda by adopting
the simple expedient of asking the question herself
completely took the wind out of Pikey’s sails.</p>

<p>“Go back at once.” Elfreda was perfectly amazing.
“How dare you come here.” She might have been
scolding a disobedient dog. “I am quite ashamed of
you, Pikey. Didn’t I say I would write to you?”</p>

<p>A conflict began in the faithful bosom of Pikey as
an eye flashing with scorn transfixed her.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Pikey, didn’t I say I would write to
you?”</p>

<p>Faced by an attitude so preposterous yet so uncompromising,
Pikey began to feel less sure of her ground.
The dismal admission was wrung out of her that her
charge had promised to do so.</p>

<p>“Very well, then.” In spite of her green ulster and
her cheap hat Elfreda grew positively majestic. “Go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>back as quickly as ever you can and don’t dare to come
here again unless you are sent for. If you wish to
communicate with me privately, please do so by letter.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a very definite sense of outrage
Pikey felt absolutely cowed. This really was a little
spitfire and yet she was just as cool as you please.</p>

<p>“It is your duty to look after Miss&mdash;Miss What’s-her-name
and to see that she doesn’t make mistakes
or get into mischief or give us away or anything of
that kind.”</p>

<p>To the wretched Pikey’s eternal dishonor she could
only muster the spirit for a dismal and forlorn acquiescence.
Even as she did so, she knew that she
was tamely submitting to be put in the wrong. The
thought filled her with fury, but there was nothing
to be done. Ruefully she realized that the headstrong
little wretch was altogether too much for her.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I shall write to Herself.”</p>

<p>“Don’t dare to do anything of the kind.” A blue
eye suddenly blazed forth like an angry sapphire.
“Please understand that if it is found out I take all
responsibility.”</p>

<p>Pikey could only gasp.</p>

<p>“But,”&mdash;the words of the amazing Elfreda were
half ice, half fire&mdash;“if you can really behave like a
sensible creature nobody need be any the wiser.”</p>

<p>“Whatever will his lordship say?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about his lordship if I were you,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>Pikey.” The voice of the little wretch had taken the
soft wheedling tone which somehow had always been
able to get round her nurse. “Don’t worry about anything.
You’ll see it will all come right. And if it
doesn’t, the whole of the responsibility is mine.”</p>

<p>Just then Pikey would cheerfully have slain her
charge, but alas! she knew herself at heart for a
foolish fond old woman who was without any real
hope of being able to prevail against her favorite.
She never had been able to prevail against her, if it
came to that.</p>

<p>Pikey was not merely in the presence of defeat. The
final words of Elfreda struck her with panic.</p>

<p>“I want you to let me have two blouses, some silk
stockings, a pair of shoes and a decent hat as soon
as you can. Send them by post, and mind you pack
them carefully. You understand?”</p>

<p>Pikey’s heart sank. No matter what she might be
on the surface, immediately below it she was very
much a woman and by no means deficient in the intuitions
of her sex. Such a demand was full of
sinister meaning. The martial figure in khaki that
had passed on round the corner now recurred vividly
to the eye of her mind. “You must either come to
Clavering Park or I shall write to Herself.” That
should have been her rejoinder to this shameless rebel.
Beyond doubt a wise woman would have made it,
but do as she would at this fatal moment she simply
could not find the necessary courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“Address the parcel to Miss Cass, in the care of
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson at The Laurels. I will write
it down for you so that there shall be no mistake.”</p>

<p>The amazing Elfreda calmly unbuttoned the green
ulster, produced a small pocket diary and wrote down
the address with a deliberate care that seemed decidedly
ironical. Then she tore out the leaf. “As
soon as ever you can, Pikey. You quite understand?”</p>

<p>Once more, at the tone’s finality, the duenna could
merely gasp. It was the only form of protest she
had now the wit or the power to make.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIV">XIV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ithout</span> another word Elfreda moved on
round the corner and crossed the stone bridge.
As soon as she came in view of The Laurels she
found quite a number of people collected about its
gate. It appeared that a man had just stuck a bill
on one of its wooden posts, that he was now being
severely admonished by the mistress of the house
while an edified Miss Joan, an equally edified Master
Peter, and an amused young man in khaki looked on.</p>

<p>To add to the piquancy of the scene the bill-sticker,
conscious of the fact that he was engaged on work
of national importance and that his services were at
a premium, was inclined to give as good as he got.
“Thought as how you wouldn’t mind seein’ it were
for a charitable h’object,” said the offender, doggedly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson, a tall, angular, fresh-complexioned
lady with light eyelashes and mouse-colored
hair, had a decided weakness for “the high
horse.”</p>

<p>“You had no right to think anything of the kind,”
she fluted on her favorite note of high expostulation.
“I consider it a great liberty.”</p>

<p>In spite of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson’s fierce assault
the offender stood his ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“You might at least have taken the trouble to ask
my permission. I have a great mind to have the bill
removed. As my name is not thought good enough
to appear as a Lady Patroness, although I have subscribed
for six tickets in the front seats, perhaps my
gate may not be good enough to advertise the performance.”</p>

<p>“It can come down if you like, mum,” said the bill-sticker
doggedly.</p>

<p>The mistress of The Laurels turned impressively
to the young man in khaki. “Would you have it
down, General, if the gate were yours?”</p>

<p>“I should let it stay up,” said the General, who
looked surprisingly youthful for the rank accorded
him. He spoke briefly and succinctly as one knowing
his own mind, on that particular subject at any rate;
moreover as he did so he smiled rather broadly in
the direction of the new governess who had just come
on to the scene.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, it may do so,” said Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson.
“But tell me, man”&mdash;she was determined
to ride off the field victorious&mdash;“by whose
orders did you stick it up?”</p>

<p>“The vicar’s, mum.”</p>

<p>“The vicar’s!” Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was
sensibly mollified. “Then why didn’t you say so at
once?”</p>

<p>“Because you didn’t ax me,” said the bill-sticker
with the ready defiance of true democracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>General Norris and the new governess had barely
time to exchange one furtive smile before Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
augustly interposed. “Miss Cass, remind
me after luncheon that I write to the Vicar to
complain of this man’s impertinence.”</p>

<p>Instead of regarding her employer with the smile
sycophantic as any new governess who really knew
her business might have been expected to do in such
circumstances, Miss Cass again reserved her glance
for the young man in khaki. Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
was too busy with the recalcitrant bill-sticker to
observe this breach of etiquette, but Miss Joan, a
spectacled young woman of seven, who had an uncomfortable
habit of noticing everything, noticed it
for her. Miss Joan, however, made no comment, the
bill-sticker was sent on his way, and the offending
poster was allowed to remain on the gate post of The
Laurels.</p>

<p>“<i>Grand, original production of ‘The Lady of Laxton,’</i>”
read the young man in khaki in his precise,
good-humored voice. “<i>First performance on any
stage. Under the personal direction of the author,
Sir Toby Philpot Bart and Montagu Jupp, Esquire,
of the Mayfair Theater. The cast will consist of
The Lady Elfreda Catkin and the following ladies
and gentlemen</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson brought a pair of eyeglasses
into action in order to study the <i>dramatic personæ</i>.
“Miss Ethel Lancelot is in it, I see. If she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>is as stiff in her acting as she is in herself she might
empty the Assembly Rooms quite easily. But I don’t
suppose they will be more than half full in any case.”</p>

<p>“You have taken six tickets, though,” said General
Norris cheerfully. “And if this entire list of distinguished
patronesses has done the same there may not
be so very much room in the building.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson, her
voice going a whole octave higher, “who is Lady Elfreda
Catkin? I don’t think she belongs to this part
of the world.”</p>

<p>“One of the Carabbas girls I believe,” said the
young man off-handedly.</p>

<p>“Have you met her?”</p>

<p>“No,” George Norris spoke with a slight air of
boredom. “But the <i>Society Pictorial</i> says she’s very
clever. Her portrait and all about her is in this week.”</p>

<p>“I must look at the <i>Society Pictorial</i>,” said Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson. “Have you the time, George?”</p>

<p>“Quarter to one,” said George after consulting the
watch on his wrist.</p>

<p>“Miss Cass,” fluted Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson.
“Will you walk on with the children. Please wash
their hands and brush their hair.”</p>

<p>For one very brief fraction of time it looked almost
as if the new governess would have preferred to delegate
this simple and elementary duty to Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
herself. That lady was too much
occupied with General Norris to observe the fact, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>the young woman in spectacles who noticed everything,
noticed it all right.</p>

<p>“Come on, Petah,” she said. “Come and let Miss
Cass wash your hands and brush your hair.”</p>

<p>Master Peter, whose age was five, gave himself a
shake and a wriggle. “Don’t warn-too,” he said.</p>

<p>“Petah-darling!” fluted Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
to her son and heir.</p>

<p>Miss Cass made no comment, but she took Miss
Joan quietly but firmly in one hand and Master Peter
with equal quietude and firmness in the other. Without
preface or apology she proceeded to lead them in
the direction of the house. It was not quite the mode
of procedure of former governesses&mdash;her charges had
had four within the last twelve months&mdash;but the grip
of Miss Cass was so resolute that Master Peter was
able to shake and wriggle with rather less effect than
usual.</p>

<p>“Tell me, George,” said Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson,
suddenly becoming confidential as the small procession
of three passed from view, “what do you think of
the new governess?”</p>

<p>The question was really superfluous. By the aid
of the sixth sense given to her sex in these little matters,
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was already fully informed
as to what George Norris thought of the new
governess. Moreover she had been informed so
plainly, that although the new governess had not been
four and twenty hours under her roof the subject
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>threatened already to become a matter of some concern.</p>

<p>“I think she is extremely nice.” The answer of
George Norris was simple, unstudied, genuinely sincere.
And it was very much the answer Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
anticipated, except that she had not
looked for it to be quite so candid.</p>

<p>The response of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson to what
almost amounted to enthusiasm on the part of George
Norris was rather formal. “She speaks nicely,” she
said. “And of course that is of great importance in
a governess.”</p>

<p>George Norris, who for all his remarkable array of
decorations seemed a very simple young man, naïvely
said that he supposed it must be of great importance
for a governess to speak nicely, yet he may have
thought privately, had he ever been tempted to give
thought to the subject, that it was in the nature of a
governess to do so.</p>

<p>In fact, although he did not put that view into words,
his tone rather implied it. But Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson,
who subsconciously followed his train of
ideas, felt it to be her duty to convict him of error.</p>

<p>“Governesses don’t always, I assure you,” she said.
“Our last one had quite a cockney accent.”</p>

<p>George Norris seemed surprised at the revelation.</p>

<p>“I am sure I hope Miss Cass will suit us.” The
tone of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson did not sound very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>optimistic. “One finds governesses such a difficult
class. You see they are not always ladies.”</p>

<p>George Norris betrayed more surprise. But Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson’s confession was not without a
certain method.</p>

<p>She was by no means well pleased that her guest
should have walked into Clavering with Miss Cass.
He was a young man who in the course of four years
had won really remarkable military distinction, but
his hostess could not disguise from herself that his
knowledge of the world had hardly kept pace with
his martial renown. In a word he lacked social experience.</p>

<p>The truth was Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had come
to regard herself as the social mentor of General Norris.
In a peculiar degree she felt responsible for him.
His career had been one of the many romances of the
war. In August, 1914, he had been a clerk in her
husband’s office in receipt of a salary of three pounds
a week. He had joined up on the morning war
was declared, and having some little previous experience
with the local volunteer battalion, had gained
a commission almost at once. In France he had proved
himself a born soldier in much of the hardest fighting
of the war, had been twice wounded, had won
some very high distinctions, had taken a course at
the Staff College and was now a professional soldier
and a general officer to boot.</p>

<p>In launching this remarkable young man upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>world Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson may have been a little
influenced by the fact that her husband’s former clerk
had been received with open arms in certain local circles
wherein Colonel Trenchard-Simpson and herself were
constrained to move with delicacy, even if they might
be said to move in them at all. Even those most
exclusive people, the Lancelots of Amory Towers,
who wielded so much influence in that part of the
world, had taken George Norris under their wing.
He had neither money nor prospects apart from his
profession and very little was known of his origin, but
in the little world of Clavering St. Mary’s, Colonel
(on carpet consideration) Trenchard-Simpson’s ex-clerk
was cutting just now such an amazingly distinguished
figure that the wife of his former employer
felt that she really owed it to George Norris to do
what she could for him.</p>

<p>He had been housed at The Laurels rather less than
a week as an honored guest, but his manly and judicious
bearing had impressed his hostess so favorably
that she had already invited Miss Dolores Parbury,
a niece of her husband’s, who lived at Birmingham,
to spend a few days under that hospitable roof.</p>

<p>The father of Miss Parbury had been able to leave
the fair Dolores some six thousand a year; and as
he had been a successful retail grocer and his only
daughter had inherited not merely his money but also
his view of life, she had rather set her heart upon
“marrying a title.” It was a nice point, of course,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>whether a mere Brigadier-General fulfilled this condition,
but Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson, after due reflection,
came to the conclusion that she was fully justified
in the special circumstances in sending for her
husband’s niece.</p>

<p>Dolores was due to arrive at The Laurels in the
course of the afternoon and at luncheon her coming
was much discussed. Colonel Trenchard-Simpson, a
recently hyphenated auctioneer, with a bald head and
a loud voice, was proud of his niece. Six thousand
a year is six thousand a year even if it is the fruit of
retail grocery. On the other hand Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
in her heart was not quite sure whether
Dolores was not a blot on the family escutcheon; she
herself was the daughter of a button manufacturer
who had dabbled in local politics to the extent of a
knighthood. But such glittering accounts were given
of her to George Norris that, had the young man
been romantically inclined, extravagant hopes must
have been raised in his bosom.</p>

<p>The new governess during her first luncheon at The
Laurels was really more interested in her immediate
surroundings than in the coming of Miss Parbury.
There were several reasons for this. Foremost of
course were the surprising circumstances. She had
not been long enough in them as yet to regret the
wicked trick she had played. Everything, so far, was
new and strange. She had never seen people quite like
these, nor had she ever found herself in this kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>household. Everything, including the table decorations,
the menu, the conversation, the style and manner
of the parlor-maid, came to her at a new and
curious angle. But with Miss Joan one side of her
and Master Peter the other, her opportunities for observation
were a little curtailed. And when Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson instructed her rather pointedly to
cut up the food of the one and to see that the other
consumed hers properly, somehow these opportunities
were curtailed still further.</p>

<p>There was another drawback also. And it was of
an embarrassing, if temporary, character. Joan, it
seemed, had told her mother of the meeting of Miss
Cass and the strange woman. Moreover, the visit
of Pikey had been duly reported by the parlor-maid.
“Tell me, Miss Cass,” fluted Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
midway through the meal, “who was the person
who came to see you this morning?”</p>

<p>Several courses were open to Elfreda. Perhaps the
one most obvious was to lie royally. But she was such
a calm and collected young woman that she promptly
decided to amuse herself by telling the blunt and
literal truth. “Oh, that old thing,” she said with a
careless laugh that did credit to her histrionic powers.
“She’s an old servant of my mother’s who happens to
be living here just now.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the offhand tone was a little overdone.
It did not actually arouse suspicion, but such
a casualness of manner with its underlying arrogance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>was hardly to be looked for in a governess. It did not
occur to Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson that Miss Cass
had anything to conceal, but certainly there was something
about the new governess that was decidedly odd.
There were moments when she seemed almost to patronize
her employers, had it been humanly possible for
her to do so. Certainly her manner made pursuit of
this particular topic very difficult indeed.</p>

<p>Making allowance for all things, Elfreda’s first
luncheon at The Laurels was a new and salutary experience,
yet perhaps it was the young man seated
opposite who interested her most. And as it was
her nature to follow her own bent as far as circumstances
allowed, General Norris received the lion’s
share of her conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson remarked privately to her
husband after the meal, while Miss Cass put on the
gaiters of Miss Joan and Master Peter and otherwise
prepared them for the afternoon’s airing, that no
matter what else the new governess might be, she
certainly was not shy. She talked easily and with
point on any subject that came uppermost, but somehow
her discourse seemed lacking in that subtle deference
which surely should have been exacted by their
respective conditions. Nor was she at all well up in
her duties, either; she certainly seemed to pay more
attention to the guest than to her employers or their
offspring; in a word, although she was a young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
of undeniably good address, Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
doubted gravely whether she would suit.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there was one point on which that
lady had already reached a decision. She must speak
to the new governess on the subject of walking into
Clavering with General Norris. As a matter of fact
the point was raised rather sooner than Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
had anticipated. The children, duly
gaitered and gloved, announced that they were going
to show Miss Cass the way to Copt Wood, whereupon
General Norris remembered that he had promised to
walk over to see some people who lived in that direction
and made an offer to accompany the party.</p>

<p>The offer was promptly accepted by the children,
but their mother felt obliged to lead the new governess
aside before the expedition started and lay down
rules for their guidance. She must not take the children
to Copt Wood if General Norris insisted on going
there, nor must she take them in any other direction
in which he proposed to go. And while on the
subject she had reluctantly but rather pointedly to
refer to their morning’s expedition into the town.
Such a thing must not occur again.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that Elfreda felt perfectly
furious. She would like to have slain this complacent
and overbearing dame. For the time being, however,
she was defenseless. Her color mounted high as
she said that it was by no wish of hers that they had
walked into Clavering together. To this Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
rejoined in a rather “Tell-that-to-the-Marines”
sort of tone that whether Miss Cass had
wished it or not it must not happen again.</p>

<p>The upshot was that when Miss Joan and Master
Peter took the air they were hauled rather peremptorily
and decidedly against their inclination in a direction
opposite to Copt Wood, while General Norris,
who seemed a shade disconsolate, was left to follow
a lonely path to that part of the landscape.</p>

<p>While Elfreda and her charges trekked along the
high road for a stolid two miles and back again the
thoughts of the rebel were dark indeed. She was
leading a life that hitherto she had hardly guessed at
and already she had found it quite surprisingly full
of thorns. There was every reason to congratulate
her private stars that it was a kind of life she had
never been used to; at the same time even this brief
taste of servitude was curiously galling.</p>

<p>On the return of Miss Cass and the children to The
Laurels shortly before four o’clock they found the
fair Dolores in the act of arrival from Birmingham.
She and several imposing boxes were being solemnly
disgorged from the household chariot while Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson stood by in an attitude of mingled
authority and adoration.</p>

<p>“Oh, the darlings!” was the greeting of Miss Parbury
to Miss Joan and Master Peter.</p>

<p>She was a lady with a very loud voice and an assurance
of manner that was little short of stupendous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>It may have been for these reasons, or for reasons
more subtle, that the new governess who was a young
woman of quick and extremely definite intuitions decided
almost as soon as she saw Miss Parbury that
she was not going to like her. For one thing, although
her reception of the children was stressed
almost to the point of effusion, she hardly so much
as looked at the green ulster even when Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
introduced its occupant; she addressed
no remark then to Miss Cass nor later over the tea
cups when the governess and her charges were allowed
to enter the drawing room.</p>

<p>The manner of Miss Parbury was forthcoming, yet
she was not a great talker. Her conversation appeared
to consist mainly of “I mean to say”&mdash;at least
impartially considered that was the gist of it. Exactly
what Miss Parbury did mean to say, even when she
had said all she had to say, would have taken a very
wise person to determine. Still she was by no means
ineffective in a metallic sort of way. Everything
about her was metallic, her voice, her appearance, her
dress, her mode of attack, yet when all was said she
was hardly as metallic as her hostess. Birmingham,
it is true, was Miss Parbury’s home town, but Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson had the further advantage of
being the daughter of a button manufacturer who had
received the honor of knighthood. Both ladies, however,
were bright specimens of the particular style
they affected; it was in the nature of a physical feat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>but not for an instant did they fail to live up to it;
and in the case of Miss Parbury, with a cool six
thousand a year at the back of her decided good looks,
this achievement was rewarded by the number of her
conquests in the midland counties. In fact it was
clear almost before General Norris had returned from
his lonely trek in the vicinity of Copt Wood that the
accomplished Miss Parbury did not look for much
difficulty in adding another male scalp to her already
fairly large collection.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> Elfreda dressed for dinner in her meager and
cheerless bedroom she felt that interesting developments
might be at hand. Her sense of humor
was keen and she was ready to enjoy every moment
of the situation for which she had made herself responsible.
It would not be her fault if coming events
did not help to lighten her lot. Secretly, however,
she was more deeply annoyed than she chose to admit,
even to herself, by Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson’s ukase.
How dare the woman, how dare any woman venture
to treat her in that way! She must try to remember,
of course, that the position she now chose to occupy
was quite outside her experience; at the same time
while the new governess in the privacy of her room
proceeded to inspect the array of evening garments
in the tin trunk labeled “Cass,” she felt absurdly
hostile, not merely to Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson, but
also to the relations and friends of that lady and to
all their works.</p>

<p>Consideration of the wardrobe of Miss Cass disclosed
it to be strictly, even painfully, limited. In
spite of this handicap, Elfreda, however, was fully
determined to make the most of herself for that evening,
and took considerable pains with her toilette.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>The best she could muster was a black silk skirt, a
semi-décolleté blouse of black chiffon and a pair of
velvet slippers. Elfreda was much too matter of fact
to paint extravagant pictures of her own appearance,
but when she looked in the glass and beheld the prim
result of her labors it needed all the humor she
possessed to save her from laughing on the wrong side
of her mouth.</p>

<p>Still, the fighting spirit of a hundred “Catkin Earls”
or so had been awakened in the frilled bosom of the
new governess. Black chiffon or no black chiffon,
she was out for blood that evening. She went down
to dinner on the stroke of eight with certain grim
thoughts smoldering in the depths of a heart that
had inherited a quite honest share of natural arrogance.
In the drawing room General Norris stood
in the center of the hearthrug, alone. The master and
mistress of the house and the fair Dolores were not
quite up to time.</p>

<p>“I hope you enjoyed your walk, Miss Cass.” The
young man’s voice sounded just a shade reproachful.</p>

<p>“Ye-es.” There was a world of doubt in the tone
of the new governess, but in the odd way she had of
looking at people she looked at George Norris. There
was a smile in the look, which in spite of the circumstances
or perhaps because of them, was somehow
queerly attractive. You couldn’t call her pretty, the
young man decided, but in that smile was something,
although perhaps he didn’t know it, which spoke to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>him far more deeply than a merely superficial attractiveness
would have done. As for Elfreda, she had
reached the conclusion already that this distinguished
soldier was a very simple and extraordinarily handsome
young man.</p>

<p>Their brief talk was interrupted almost at once by
the entrance of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson and the fair
Dolores. The lady of Birmingham looked more metallic
than ever in a glittering green dress with hair
ornament to match, yet so clear was her skin, so good
were her teeth, so bright was her hair that most people
would have considered her uncommonly handsome.
At any rate that was Miss Parbury’s estimate of herself
and she had all the assurance of recognized
beauty. The single glance she cast at the chiffon
blouse and the cheap black skirt of the little governess
had a touch of scornful pity. Perhaps it would have
been pity unadulterated had she not already discussed
Miss Cass with her hostess and had they not agreed to
doubt whether the new governess quite knew her
place.</p>

<p>During dinner, alas, this doubt crystallized into
certainty. Miss Cass did not know her place. She
insisted on taking such an important part in the conversation
that the fair Dolores and even Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
herself came perilously near to being
outshone. On every subject that presented itself for
discussion she talked confidently and with point, and
from time to time, to the growing resentment of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>other ladies, she even dared to indulge in a little badinage.
Governesses at The Laurels in the last four
years had been many, but before the meal was at an
end Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had sorrowfully concluded
that this was a new kind of governess altogether.</p>

<p>Miss Cass had been highly recommended by no less
a person than Canon Carnaby of Laxton, whose
brother, the Reverend Sirius Carnaby, was the venerable
incumbent of the neighboring parish of Yeldham,
but her conduct at the dinner table, in the
stern purview of her critics really amounted to “showing
off.” For a full half of the meal she entirely
monopolized General Norris, that is to say she would
have monopolized him had not the hostess and Miss
Parbury been determined that she should not; for the
other half she was bewildering the company with the
originality of her remarks, the independence of her
judgment and the range of her information. Just
before the meal came to an end, however, she was
guilty of a decidedly bad break.</p>

<p>Apart from the military prowess of George Norris,
his real claim to distinction in the sight of his former
employers was that he had been “taken up” by some
very “nice” people. Foremost among these was that
exclusive clan the Lancelots of Amory Towers, the
chimney pots of whose ancestral seat were visible on
a clear day from The Laurels’ back windows. The
Lancelots were the sun of the local firmament round
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>which all minor stars and planets were more or less
content to revolve. This family was too well established
to insist unduly on its position; for generations
its name had been known for miles round not merely
as a symbol of place and power, but also as a cause
of place and power in others. The Lancelots were
what their neighbors desired to be; at least that was
the opinion of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson, although just
what they were beyond the fact that they were “very
influential” would have been difficult to say.</p>

<p>Still, there was no gainsaying the fact that George
Norris, who four years and three months ago had
been a clerk earning a modest three pounds a week in
the office of a Clavering auctioneer, had several times
been invited to luncheon and dinner by the Lancelots,
and Miss Ethel herself, the bright one of the family,
had only last week attempted the fox-trot with him in
public. It is true that it was at the Assembly Rooms
in the cause of mercy, but either Miss Ethel was growing
extremely progressive for a virgin of thirty or the
stock of George Norris was rising to a perilous height
in the local market.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the meal the Lancelots were
rather freely discussed and it was then that the new
governess by a series of incautious remarks lent piquancy
to the conversation. In fact she betrayed a
knowledge so intimate of this distinguished clan that
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was impelled to challenge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>it. By what means had Miss Cass acquired so much
information concerning them?</p>

<p>The new governess inadvertently replied that the
Lancelots were old friends of her mother’s.</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> mother’s, Miss Cass?” said Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
sharply; “but I am speaking of the Lancelots
of Amory Towers.”</p>

<p>In cool tones Elfreda made it quite clear that she
also was speaking of the Lancelots of Amory Towers.</p>

<p>“But how does <i>your</i> mother come to know them?”
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson offered open battle to Miss
Cass.</p>

<p>The new governess smiled frankly and cheerfully
as she caught the eye of the young man opposite.
“Well you see&mdash;&mdash;” The unconscious insolence of the
slight drawl amounted to downright bad form in any
governess, new or otherwise. “Well, you see my
father happened to be the butler at Amory Towers
and my mother was lady’s maid.”</p>

<p>A solemn pause ensued. Finally it was broken by
a gurgle of suppressed laughter from General Norris.
The tension which gripped the dinner table was thereby
released, but even in the myopic sight of Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson the lie of the new governess was
so palpable that she decided at once that Miss Cass
would have to take another situation at the end of
her month.</p>

<p>For the rest of the evening the other ladies were
openly hostile to Miss Cass. In the drawing room
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>this attitude grew quite marked, when during Miss
Parbury’s brilliant performance&mdash;brilliancy was her
note in everything, the key, in fact, of her personality&mdash;of
Opp’s Prelude in A minor upon the piano-forte
the new governess persistently indulged in loud
and animated chatter with General Norris. Broad
hints were given that such conduct was unseemly, but
they did not make one pennyworth of difference. It
was almost as if Miss Cass took a malicious pleasure
in flouting Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson and in restricting
the opportunities of Miss Parbury who found herself
quite at a loss. General Norris was much to
blame, no doubt, but he was to be excused on the
ground of social inexperience. For the new governess
there was no excuse. Such behavior could not be
passed over. As the clock on the chimney piece
chimed ten Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was moved to
put her just resentment into words.</p>

<p>“Miss Cass”&mdash;perhaps the resentment was more
apparent in the tone than in the words themselves&mdash;“you
must really go to bed, I think. The children’s
breakfast is at half-past eight, you know. They were
ten minutes late this morning.”</p>

<p>Elfreda rose at once with the meaningful look that
both ladies had now come to dislike so intensely. General
Norris convoyed her to the drawing room door
and opened it with a deference not lost upon them.
Moreover they observed the frank and ready smile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>with which she rewarded the young man and the look
he gave her in return.</p>

<p>Elfreda went to her chill nest very well content with
her evening’s work. She had made the discovery
already that but for the presence in the house of General
Norris, life at The Laurels as nursery governess
would be quite insupportable. However, he was a
very interesting young man and the fact lent piquancy
to the situation. And the manner in which the other
ladies had chosen to bear themselves in it had roused
Elfreda’s fighting spirit to a perilous pitch. More
than ever was she determined to “ride off” the fair
Dolores; and she also expected a reasonable measure
of amusement in the process.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the drawing room the mistress of the
house was seeking balm for her protégé. “I will see
that she dines upstairs to-morrow, dear.” With these
discreetly whispered words did Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
salve the wounds of the fair Dolores as General
Norris closed the door softly and smilingly upon the
new governess.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the meantime gloom and anxiety reigned at
Clavering Park. By just missing the bus from
the Pendennis Arms, Pikey delayed her return from
The Laurels until nearly three o’clock. Therefore
Miss Cass decided to obey orders and by pleading a
headache take luncheon in bed. Several good reasons
led her to do so. Apart from the fact that Girlie’s
respect for her stern custodian was tinged with awe,
she was more comfortable in the security of her own
room than she was likely to be anywhere else in that
house at that moment. Besides, although she had
given up a whole morning to the diligent study of
“The Lady of Laxton,” at present she was very far
from being word perfect in her part; thus she did not
feel equal to the task of going through a rehearsal
that afternoon. And sum and crown of all her woes,
was the haunting continual fear of the arrival of Mr.
Montagu Jupp.</p>

<p>That veritable Old Man of the Sea was expected
from London by the four o’clock train. It needed no
great amount of foresight on the part of Miss Cass to
realize that when that event happened the game would
be up. All the morning as she wrestled with Sir
Toby’s dialogue, Mr. Montagu Jupp was a specter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>in the background of her thoughts. Should she
make a clean breast of the matter there and then
and so anticipate the public exposure that was inevitable
later in the day? She was in such a state of
panic that there seemed much to be said for that
course, yet after all, as further reflection showed,
there was nothing to gain by a bootless confession.
At all events it would be wise to await the return of
Pikey, if only because she had promised to bring
Lady Elfreda with her. But there could be no building
upon that. It was always possible, of course, that
the Evil Genius was already bored sufficiently by her
taste of drudgery to come and face the music, but
poor Girlie was very far from counting upon the fact.</p>

<p>Pikey, however, returned Elfreda-less but terribly
cross. Indeed “cross” was altogether too mild a
word for her mood. It was really so savage that for
a time the hapless Deputy could do nothing with her.
Moreover, so completely was Girlie under the spell of
Mr. Montagu Jupp that her will became inert. In sheer
desperation she resigned herself to her bed for the
rest of that day at least. By that means she would
avoid Mr. Montagu Jupp until the morrow and so
put off the hour of discovery.</p>

<p>Downstairs, in the meantime, consternation was
rife. The sudden indisposition of the leading lady
had caused the first rehearsal to be postponed. But
Sir Toby was by profession an optimist. He looked
at the world he lived in and all the beings who inhabited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
it through rose-colored spectacles. It was
“good form” to do so. Every woman of his acquaintance
was “a dear” or she was “charming,” every man
was “a sportsman” and a good fellow. Clouds had
been known to obscure the sun now and again, but
after all they were only a temporary matter. He was
a believer in a bright and cheerful world. That was
the only side of the picture he could ever condescend
to recognize. Nevertheless, even Sir Toby allowed, in
the privacy of his heart, that “The Lady of Laxton”
might prove an ambitious undertaking for a decidedly
scratch company at short notice.</p>

<p>However, the author of the piece had a real stand-by
in Montagu Jupp. That famous man was said by
common report “to know the theater backwards.” He
had only to set his hand to the business for all to be
well. His arrival by the four o’clock train was
eagerly awaited. Even Sir Toby’s optimism deigned
to regard the coming of the great and admired Montagu
as a <i>sine qua non</i>. He knew all about everything,
theatrically speaking. Not only was he a “producer,”
he was a Napoleon among producers. And
on his own showing he had yet to learn the meaning
of the word “failure.”</p>

<p>Alas, when the omnibus returned from Clavering
station on the stroke of five, a chill descended upon
the bevy of tea drinkers in the hall. The great man
had not arrived. But in lieu of him a telegram had
been handed to the chauffeur on the journey home. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>was addressed to Sir Toby Philpot and it contained
the dire news that Mr. Montagu Jupp was “unavoidably
detained, important business.”</p>

<p>Sir Toby was stout of heart, but a cloud, an unmistakable
cloud passed across the sun of his optimism.
There was much to do and but a very little
time in which to do it. His star artiste, upon whom
so much depended, had taken to her bed; his other
stand-by had let him down at the last moment; and
the performance was already widely advertised to
take place in the Assembly Rooms at Clavering on
the following Tuesday. Moreover, Sir Toby in the
bounty of his nature had given an undertaking that
the performance should be repeated in the Town Hall
at the neighboring city of Meichester three days later.</p>

<p>It was the hostess herself who presently bore the
news of Mr. Montagu Jupp’s non-arrival to King
Edward’s bedroom. Girlie was sitting up in bed in
a beribboned dressing jacket, grappling bravely with
the typescript of her part. No doubt it was an act
of sheer despair, but her mind in the present state
of its infirmity craved occupation. The severe task
of committing to memory Sir Toby’s dialogue was by
way of being an antidote to her many terrors. And
when the yellow chrysanthemum lady, full of counsel
and solicitude, came and sat by her bed, and bitterly
deplored Mr. Jupp’s failure to appear, it was almost
as if the invalid gained strength from the woes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>others. At all events it suddenly occurred to her that
she might be able to come down to dinner.</p>

<p>The kindly hostess was far from urging that course
upon her guest, but certainly Lady Elfreda’s early reappearance
would lessen the gloom that had fallen
upon Mrs. Spencer-Jobling and other members of the
cast, and even upon Sir Toby himself. So sharp was
the recoil from the certainty of immediate discovery
that Girlie began to feel quite bold. Her long day in
bed had been a torture and a weariness, Pikey since
her return from The Laurels had been intolerable, and
the postponement of the worst had brought such relief
that in the sudden reaction Girlie took heart of grace.</p>

<p>A sword hung over her head which sooner or later
must fall. In the meantime, desperation nerved her
and she decided upon a run for her money. She was
not without courage, or it may have been that the rewards
of courage inspired her to an unnatural hardihood.
At any rate, a festive dinner downstairs, even
if a little too highly spiced with adventure, was greatly
to be preferred to a further prolonged mope in bed.</p>

<p>When, however, the hostess had left the room and
the Deputy informed Pikey of her decision, there was
a clash of wills. That autocrat vetoed the proposal
ruthlessly. Miss No-Class would be far safer where
she was. But the student of <i>The Patrician</i> had made
up her mind. Now that Mr. Montagu Jupp was a peril
less imminent, she was in such an agreeable state of
recoil that the previous evening had become a proud
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>and happy memory. Looking back upon it in perspective,
she felt entitled to consider herself a success.</p>

<p>Let her rise to the height of her opportunity! That
thought was ever in her mind. A heavy penalty would
be exacted from her presently, her career as a governess
would be ruined, but in the meantime if she
were really wise she would “see life,” and boldly play
her part in a tragi-comedy which one day might make
her as famous as Miss Mary Cholmondeley or Mrs.
Elinor Glyn. No matter what the future had in store
she would weave into her life a high experience that
should even raise her above the Brontës and all their
gifts.</p>

<p>Pikey continued to breathe slaughter and fire, but the
Deputy, sustained by thoughts of the renown that
might one day be hers, showed a firmness amounting
to heroism.</p>

<p>“I will have a bath&mdash;please. And I will wear the
blue dress.”</p>

<p>Could Pikey have had her way, she would have
beaten the small plebeian soundly and put her back into
bed. But the duenna was shaken a good deal by the
tribulations of the day. She was feeling weak and
she was filled with despair. The unexpected defiance
vanquished her. Sullenly she prepared the bath, sullenly
she went through the toilette ritual. But on this
occasion her proud spirit had to submit to rebuke.</p>

<p>“You are hurting me.” The Deputy tried her utmost
to speak sternly, even if the result was not as impressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
as she could have wished. “I think I can manage
my hair quite well myself, thank you.”</p>

<p>Pikey was still strong enough not to yield her office,
but her methods became less drastic. The Deputy,
however, was not permitted to wear the blue dress.
She was curtly told that <i>real</i> ladies did not appear in
the same frock on two successive evenings. An affair
of pink silk was unwillingly placed at her disposal.
And when Girlie came to look at herself in the glass,
she found it just as becoming and slightly more modern
in style. Perhaps it did not go quite so well with her
eyes, but in the course of an epic twenty-four hours
the rose had deepened in her cheeks, so that all things
considered “what she lost on the roundabouts she
gained on the swings.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> anxieties of the day had not improved the
nerves of Miss Cass. They were a little frayed,
no doubt, when she was led in to dinner on the arm
of the genial, loud-voiced host. Mr. Minever was a
great one for chaff and there was something about
poor Girlie’s woe-begone appearance that was a direct
challenge to his powers. Had the Bartlet’s masterpiece
proved too much for her? If the little man wrote as
he talked she was a very wise young woman, in Mr.
Minever’s opinion, to keep her bed in order to grapple
with his dialogue. Sir Toby laughed brightly at all
the sallies which reached his end of the table, where the
luckless yellow chrysanthemum lady and Mrs. Spencer-Jobling
were bearing up with superhuman patience.
Still, it has to be said for Sir Toby that he was a little
sportsman in his way.</p>

<p>From time to time, as the noisily cheerful meal went
on, Sir Toby stole a glance down the table at the innocent
cause of the mirth. She really was nailingly pretty,
although her color was so high this evening that it
could hardly be her own. The little man grew pensive,
not to say distrait. By the time the port appeared it
had begun to seem rather a pity that Carabbas notoriously
“hadn’t a bob.” Still Grandpapa Angora was on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>his last legs according to all accounts, and even if
keeping up a dukedom was becoming an expensive
hobby and supertax was now on a very democratic
basis, the head of the clan must surely have kept a little
bit in the family stocking just to bring them in out of
the rain.</p>

<p>Indeed, that seemed quite a fascinating speculation
as Sir Toby preened his small tail feathers and held the
door for the ladies to file cheerfully and jauntily out
of the room. But one there was neither jaunty nor
cheerful. She was a duke’s granddaughter it was true,
but she was so timid and demure that she might have
been a nursery governess. Her one desire, seemingly,
was to efface herself altogether. And yet, as Sir Toby
reflected, there <i>is</i> something to be said after all for
pedigree stock. These Sheffielders&mdash;or was it Leeds
they came from?&mdash;with their familiarity, their badinage,
their amazing self-confidence, how tiresome they
were! The little Catkin Puss might be dull&mdash;dull as a
mud fence&mdash;but when the worst had been said, she was
a Lady!</p>

<p>“Penny for your thoughts, Philpot.” The loud-voiced
host emphasized this speculative offer by pushing
his so-called 1890 towards Sir Toby.</p>

<p>“Worth a sight more than that, ain’t they, Pot?”
quoth a puffy man opposite with a face as red as a
boiled lobster. And then, to Sir Toby’s unspeakable
annoyance, he winked impudently at the others. “But
I’m bound to say I admire your taste.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>The retort which rose to the long suffering lips of
Sir Toby was, “I wish I could return the compliment!”
That would have been a fit reply to one who always
made a point of treating him as if he were still in
Puppyhole. His tormentor, one Garden by name, was
a man of some parts, but in the course of a rather
hopeless life, having done most things and most people,
he had steadily declined in the world’s esteem, until
now there was only dramatic criticism, occasional journalism
and the tolerance of club acquaintances between
the jail, the poorhouse and himself.</p>

<p>Soft, however, was Sir Toby’s answer. This same
Garden had once kicked him round Sixpenny, and although
the experience had not done him as much good
as it might have, the little baronet had a deep-seated
desire that it should never happen again.</p>

<p>The host, however, that prince of crude fellows
whose size in dancing pumps was a large ten, lost no
time in putting his foot still deeper in the mire. Before
Sir Toby could deal efficiently with his ancient foe,
Mr. Minever had coarsely guffawed, “So does Duckingfield.”
At this breach of taste on the part of the
host, Sir Toby glared. And the new peer glared also.</p>

<p>“I <i>fink</i> you are up for the O. B. H.,” said Sir
Toby in tones that would have re-frozen an icicle.</p>

<p>The host grinned at Garden. “Means he’s going to
see about pilling me, eh?”</p>

<p>Said that worthy, “If he does, you’ll get in for sure.”</p>

<p>“S-s-sh! Don’t give it away!” Again the host
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>grinned at Garden. “But, seriously, she’s as pretty as
pretty. And I’m willing to lay a hundred to ten she
gets off before next season.”</p>

<p>Ruefully and wrathfully reflected Sir Toby, “This
man Minever doesn’t begin to be Sahib. An awful pity
we are not stayin’ with somebody else. However....”</p>

<p>As for my lord of Duckingfield, whose hostile gaze
was short-circuiting Sir Toby’s inmost thoughts, he
too was nursing an almost savage antagonism. “Like
to punch his head for him”&mdash;that was its formula. But
whose head it was that the honest and forthright Midlander
yearned to punch was not exactly clear. He
certainly glared at the host as the desire passed through
his mind, but with even greater intensity he glared at
Sir Toby.</p>

<p>Howbeit, Sir Toby returned the gesture with interest.
The little man had been only too quick to read
the thought in the mind of the presumptuous maker
of munitions. How dare this newest of new men lift
his eyes to a duke’s granddaughter?</p>

<p>To some minds it is not the least of the advantages
pertaining to an old title that it is competent to ask
these questions!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring</span> the epic days which followed, the mind
of Sir Toby was haunted by this inquiry. But
there were matters almost as vital to vex that ingenuous
soul. From the first the rehearsals were not at all
satisfactory. The author of “The Lady of Laxton”
did not pretend to be more than a tyro in theatrical
affairs and the company he had gathered to embody
the heir of his invention was as resolutely “amateur,”
if rather less enthusiastic, than himself. In the first
place “social position” was felt to be even more
important than histrionic ability, a fact which made
the eleventh-hour defection of Mr. Montagu Jupp the
more to be deplored. He was to have been the prop
and mainstay of “the production.” But, as the cynical
Garden shrewdly declared, the astute Montagu must
have smelt a rat.</p>

<p>“I hope, Pot,” said that critic when the second rehearsal
had come to its dismal end and a dark specter
was invading Sir Toby’s life, “you were not such a
fool as to let Jupp see the list of your people.”</p>

<p>Sir Toby ingenuously admitted that he had.</p>

<p>“Hence the pyramids, my boy.” The relentless Garden
chuckled. “Unavoidably detained. Important business.
Great Cumberland place!” <i>Flaneur</i> of the <i>Dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
and Sporting Weekly</i> whistled a few bars of
Chopin’s Funeral March. “You little fathead, you
ought to be bled for the simples!”</p>

<p>“I assure you, old man,” said Sir Toby, almost tearfully,
“Lady Elfreda simply knocked ’em endways in
Yorkshire in the ‘Duke of Killiecrankie.’”</p>

<p>“But you can’t hear a word she says.”</p>

<p>It was fatally true, and there was the crux of the
whole matter. The star artiste, upon whom so very
much depended, might never have been on a stage before.
So far she was grievously disappointing. She
showed little intelligence and less aptitude, and she was
so shy of opening her mouth that it seemed certain that
“on the night” she would not be heard by the first row
of stalls.</p>

<p>So much was clear already even to the capacity of
Sir Toby Philpot. Indeed it was slowly beginning
to dawn upon him that somebody must have been
“pulling his leg.” He had been too ready to take the
word of others, of Monty Jupp for example, that Lady
Elfreda had so much talent, “that she could play the
ingénués out of all the West End theaters.”
That was the memorable phrase the sagacious and admired Montagu
had used. The old wretch had simply been pulling
his leg. No wonder that important business kept
him from Clavering St. Mary’s. “What a fool I have
been,” reflected the despondent author, “not to take the
simple precaution of seeing the girl act before counting
upon her to pull us through.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>In the course of the third rehearsal, which proved
even more trying than the other two, the company
began to show unmistakable signs of mutiny. Mrs.
Spencer-Jobling, for instance, who felt she had a reputation
to lose on the stage if nowhere else, became so
openly and mordantly sarcastic that she actually reduced
the leading lady to tears. Later in the day a
sort of informal meeting was held in the library, at
which Garden presided, in the course of which it was
decided to present an ultimatum to Sir Toby. Either
he must obtain professional assistance and advice or
the cast would throw up their parts en masse.</p>

<p>Only five days now remained, for on the following
Tuesday the performance was due in the Assembly
Rooms. Faced by this ultimatum Sir Toby was in
despair. But one fact was clear. If the situation was
to be saved a Titan was called for. At all hazards the
recalcitrant Montagu must come down to Clavering
Park. And all the art, all the tact, all the experience
of even that superman would be necessary if the curtain
was to rise on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>With the ferocity of despair Sir Toby telephoned
at once to the great man’s chambers in the Albany.
Alas, Mr. Montagu Jupp was out of town, but he was
expected from Newmarket in the course of that evening.
Soon after dinner Sir Toby telephoned again,
but Montagu had not returned. Finally, on the verge
of midnight, the author telephoned a third time and
on this occasion success rewarded him. The authentic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>voice of Montagu informed him that he had just
donned his pyjamas. That plea, however, was of no
avail; for a long twenty minutes he had to suffer the
prayers and the entreaties of the unlucky author of
“The Lady of Laxton.” But to these he was deaf.
Mr. Montagu Jupp had reasons of his own for not
throwing himself into the breach. He remained adamant.
Important business must keep him in town for
at least another week, shamelessly adding particularly
as he had just lost a valuable day at Newmarket.</p>

<p>Then it was that Sir Toby, knowing all to be lost
unless Montagu relented, hastily decided upon a final
and desperate throw. He would run up to town by the
early morning train and so bring home to the great
man the extreme urgency of the whole position. And
in the evening he would return with him to Clavering
Park if flesh and blood could compass that essential
deed.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>ime</span> was precious indeed if “The Lady of Laxton”
was ever to know the vicarious glamour
of the footlights, but an acute sense of relief was felt
by all the members of the cast when at breakfast time
the next morning it was announced that for that day
at least there was to be an interregnum. In the absence
of Sir Toby there would be no further rehearsal
until the following day. And to no member of the
company was the news quite so welcome as the leading
lady.</p>

<p>Girlie had been nearly a week now at Clavering Park
and events were nerving her almost to the pitch of
desperation. She had reached the point at which she
hardly cared what happened. Yet if not exactly a
fighter she had the tenacity that often goes with weak
natures, and there were certain aspects of the adventure,
strange nightmare as it was, that were delightful.
In spite of the drawbacks to a position which she had
been absolutely mad to accept, this was Life with a
very large letter. As far as she herself was concerned
it was all a wonder and a wild desire, a never-to-be-forgotten
romance, a complex of soul-harrowing torments
and delirious possibilities. She really felt that
if she could emerge from this position of peril
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>without being damned eternally in the sight of the
world, she would have gained so much first-hand experience
that she might hope to become one of the
foremost novelists of her time and country.</p>

<p>All the same it needed every spark of will power she
could summon not to run away. Each night as she
came to assuage her throbbing temples with the luxury
of King Edward’s bedroom and the incidents of
the day recurred to her, how she contrived to go on
“sticking it” she simply did not know. Time and again
as she realized how near she must be to discovery she
shuddered in the depths of her soul. And heaven knew
what penalty would be exacted when the discovery was
inevitably made!</p>

<p>Had a reasonable alternative presented itself she
must have bolted after her abject failure at the third
rehearsal. By no means a fool, she was only too keenly
aware of the veiled hostility and the covert sarcasms
of the other ladies. But what could she do? Where
could she go? She had no money beyond a few rapidly
diminishing Bradburys. She had no home, no
friends; above all, she had thrown away her situation
without any sort of hope of getting another one. Merely
to review such a position was to induce a paralysis
of the will. Whatever happened she must hold on a
little while longer, if only in self defense. Yet as she
clearly foresaw the time was surely coming when she
must be found out, or still worse, when her overdriven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>nerves would give way and compel her to throw up the
sponge.</p>

<p>It was a huge relief, therefore, to learn that the rehearsals
were suspended until Sir Toby’s return. But
it was certainly tempered as far as Miss Cass was concerned,
by Mr. Minever’s announcement at breakfast
that the little man had sworn a great oath that he would
bring Monty Jupp back with him or he would die in
the attempt. Opinion was divided as to whether or
not Sir Toby would have to embrace the grim alternative.
The majority, however, were so emphatic
that Sir Toby’s mission was doomed to fail, that the
trembling Girlie plucked up a little courage. After all
there was still a slender hope that the mysterious Providence
which so far had watched over her would continue
to do so.</p>

<p>Before the morning was far advanced Girlie had
quite an inspiration. She suddenly decided to set forth
to The Laurels and seek advice from the person best
able to give it. Moreover, this course of action commended
itself to Pikey. When the Dragon was informed
of the project she agreed that in the circumstances
it was quite the best thing the Deputy could
do and gave her some sound advice as to the best means
of getting there.</p>

<p>Cunning was needed to escape the attentions of the
hostess and her fellow guests. Yet it was not really
difficult to slip away unseen, for by this time, having
become thoroughly unpopular with the other members
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>of the house party, they were now leaving her severely
alone. As Girlie’s conversation was confined almost
exclusively to “Yes” and “No,” it had become rather
a moot point with the others as to whether this was
a form of “side” on the part of Lady Elfreda, or
whether it was that she was merely a fool. The more
charitable view was perhaps the latter. At any rate,
her aloofness no longer caused surprise, while her
movements generally roused no particular interest.</p>

<p>Duly instructed by Pikey and favored by a fair
share of luck, Girlie arrived at The Laurels about half-past
eleven. She was received by a rather supercilious
parlor-maid, who met her demand to see Miss Cass
by showing her into the drawing room. The parlor-maid
then asked the name of the visitor. Girlie met
the case by the modest formula, “Please say a lady
would like to see her.”</p>

<p>It happened, however, that the ever-watchful mistress
of the house was lurking near at hand. She had
observed the visitor’s arrival from the window of the
morning room and filled with curiosity she now intercepted
the parlor-maid before she could deliver the
message to Miss Cass.</p>

<p>“Who is it, Jarvis?”</p>

<p>“A lady, ma’am, to see Miss Cass. She won’t give
her name, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“How odd.” Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson ruminated
for a brief twenty seconds. Then she added, “I will
tell Miss Cass myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>Further rumination followed. In the class of
born-busybodies, Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had claims
to rank high. Curiosity stirred her in regard to this
quite attractive-looking and decidedly well-turned-out
young woman&mdash;Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson prided herself
upon being a judge of such matters&mdash;who declined
to give her name. And the new governess was
enough of “a dark horse” already without having
secretive callers to intensify the mystery. Therefore it
took Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson less than a minute to
seek the light for herself.</p>

<p>The mistress of the house entered the drawing room
flutelike but dominant, and her unexpected appearance
came to the visitor, who was girding herself to do
battle with some one very different, as a complete surprise.
Frankly, almost naïvely quizzical, the lady of
the house made no secret of a desire for information.
“Perhaps you will tell me who you are and then I will
tell Miss Cass.”</p>

<p>Somehow Girlie had not been able to foresee that
it would be necessary to provide herself with a name.
But only too clearly a name was required. And
on the spur of the moment there was only one that
came to her. Almost in spite of herself it now sprang
automatically to her lips.</p>

<p>“Lady Elfreda Catkin.”</p>

<p>It was a terrible blunder, and this Girlie realized
at the very moment in which it was made. But,
taken so completely by surprise, and faced with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>the calm insistence of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson, no
middle course seemed open. If anything, however,
this revelation of identity added fuel to the flame of
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson’s curiosity. The mystery
surrounding the new governess appeared to deepen
considerably. And it grew more intriguing than ever.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was visibly impressed. Her
first thought was that Miss Cass’s boast of the Lancelots
being old friends of her mother’s was in some sort
corroborated, her second thought was that the distinguished
friends of the new governess made her so interesting
that she was rather glad than otherwise that
Miss Cass had not yet received a month’s notice. For
the past four days, in fact, almost from the moment
of the arrival of Dolores Parbury, who had taken a
violent dislike to Miss Cass, the mistress of The Laurels
had been at the point of terminating the engagement
of that lady. But for some reason or other the
drastic step had remained in abeyance, and as Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson made a dignified progress to the
schoolroom she was inclined to rejoice that it had.</p>

<p>Miss Cass in that slow, cool, oddly imperious voice
of hers, which had the malign power of driving the
other ladies to secret fury, was in the act of setting a
sulky Master Peter and a disgruntled Miss Joan to
write to dictation. The children made no secret of the
fact that they had a hearty dislike of Miss Cass, and
that lady, if austerity of mien and acidity of tongue
were any indication, hardly cared to disguise that their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>feelings were fully reciprocated. But as the smiling
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson floated into the room, with
quite a new air of kindly politeness, and informed Miss
Cass that Lady Elfreda Catkin had called to see her
and that she now awaited her in the drawing room the
heavy thunderclouds were momentarily dispersed. All
the same, as Miss Cass laid down her book and her
pencil they suddenly returned with added density.</p>

<p>“Another friend of your mother’s, Miss Cass?”
There was not a suspicion of sarcasm in that discreet
inquiry. It was the honest child of a shameless curiosity.</p>

<p>“Ye-es.” The somewhat ambiguous reply of Miss
Cass was extremely reluctant. And there was a look
on her face that Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had no
means of interpreting.</p>

<p>“Such a pretty girl.” Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was
a little inclined to gush. “And so very young to be
such a clever actress.”</p>

<p>Miss Cass looked coldly down her arrogant nose.
The little idiot must have taken leave of her wits!</p>

<p>The new governess did not seem to be anywise flattered
by having such a very interesting young woman
to call upon her. Thunderclouds gathered even more
heavily about her as she rose from the table and made
her way to the drawing room.</p>

<p>Consumed by an intense curiosity, Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
would dearly have liked to put her ear to the
keyhole of the drawing room door. But the line has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>to be drawn somewhere, and with a sigh Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
remembered that she was “a lady.”
Well it was that she had this scruple, for the conversation
the other side of the door must have increased
the flame that was devouring her.</p>

<p>“Why are <i>you</i> here?” was Elfreda’s greeting to her
pale and embarrassed counterfeit.</p>

<p>The answer was tears.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t think I can keep on.” So complex is
the human mind that even in that moment of genuine
tragedy poor Girlie could not help noticing with what
an air of authority the blue serge skirt she had contrived
out of her meager capital and the cunning of her
own needle and the woolen jumper she had knitted herself
were now invested. The trim form of their present
wearer showed them off to rare advantage.</p>

<p>It was a painful meeting, nevertheless. Girlie was
at the limit of endurance. In the pitiless view of
the evil genius who had brought a highly respectable
daughter of suburbia to the verge of ruin she looked
even more rabbit-like than when she had seen her last.
And at that moment Elfreda’s paramount desire was
to shake her.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mean that you are going to run
away?” There was a nascent ferocity that threatened
actual bodily violence.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know,” gasped the visitor.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say they’ve found out!”</p>

<p>Girlie reluctantly admitted that they had not yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>actually done so, but that it was as certain as anything
could be that the hour was near when all must be discovered.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” was the Stoic’s answer, “if only
you keep on doing your best.”</p>

<p>But there is a limit to human endurance and
Miss Cass seemed to have reached it already. Besides
she was now in very deep waters indeed and in no sense
was she a strong swimmer. Alarming developments
threatened continually and she now felt that she simply
could not go on.</p>

<p>However, she was in the toils of an implacable will.</p>

<p>“You are bound to go through with it now,” said the
pitiless Elfreda. “It will let them down shamefully
if you run away before the performance. You must
at least wait until afterwards.”</p>

<p>“But I am sure to be found out.”</p>

<p>“You have not been found out yet, and you will not
be&mdash;if you continue to do your best.”</p>

<p>Even if Miss Cass continued to do her best, however,
and if by a supreme effort she brought herself
finally to face the music, what must be the upshot of it
all? She had no place to go to when this tragic farce
was at an end. What was to become of her? The
nearer she approached the abyss that yawned beneath
her feet the wider and blacker it looked. In the end, as
she knew only too well, that bottomless pit must devour
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“But I will certainly find you another situation&mdash;when
the time comes,” said Elfreda staunchly.</p>

<p>It was very well for the reckless author of the mischief
to promise so boldly, but what did such a promise
amount to? As far as Girlie was concerned the future
appeared hopeless.</p>

<p>Besides, the matter had another aspect, of which the
Deputy had lately been made aware. She was afraid,
she was terribly afraid, that a certain peer was on the
verge of proposing to her.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, it was a confession that Girlie
felt bound to make to her principal. Humiliating the
confession might be, a little demoralizing it certainly
was, yet bound up in it was a sense of romance,
a secret thrill of adventure. Somehow she felt bound
in honor to tell Lady Elfreda what she feared was
going to happen. Half shamefacedly she made her
odd disclosure, and yet as she did so with many blushes,
deep hesitations and some tears, it would be less than
just to Girlie or to Girlie’s sex to say that pain was
her dominant emotion.</p>

<p>As for Elfreda, when she grasped the true meaning
of the disjointed, tremulous words, she was able to
conceal her real feelings, whatever they might have
been. In that art at least she was singularly adept. A
light of humor burned in the eyes that seemed to peer
into the very soul of Girlie Cass. And then an arrogant
lip curled ever so slightly. She was justified, she
was more than justified in what she had done! The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>thought seared the pride of one who as yet had hardly
begun to learn her own intrinsic value in the matter-of-fact
world of men and things.</p>

<p>So this was the measure of the man whom her parents
considered good enough for her! In the sight of
this Crœsus any underbred little impostor was as eligible
as her authentic self. Suddenly the red light was
hoisted in Elfreda’s eyes. That rubbishy little thing
to be accepted at her surface value! Elfreda’s face
grew hard.</p>

<p>“What ought I to do?” twittered poor Girlie.</p>

<p>The eyes of this daughter of a picturesque race
altered curiously in the fragment of time that elapsed
before she could bring herself to answer the question.</p>

<p>Twittered poor Girlie again&mdash;“Do tell me, please,
what I ought to do!”</p>

<p>“Do!” The scorn was cold drawn, barbaric. “Why,
go back at once and make him propose to you. And”&mdash;the
eyes were like those of Medusa&mdash;“don’t let me
see or hear from you again until he has done so.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XX">XX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">G</span>irlie</span> could only gasp. Elfreda’s speech in its
frigid nonchalance was stupefying. More fully
than ever did she realize that she was in the toils of an
Evil Genius. This girl, this amazing girl, had a will
of iron. She was growing positively afraid of her.</p>

<p>It was all very well for Lady Elfreda Catkin to
issue an ukase, but it was not she who would have to
foot the bill. She was a person of importance, she had
powerful friends, her position was secure. No matter
how deep and angry the waters, no matter how menacing
the sky, she belonged to the class that was able to
weather the most violent storms. But for the Girlie
Casses of the planet it was a very different matter.
What for the one might be nothing more than a new
and original, if rather perilous, form of entertainment,
for the other might mean the end of all things.</p>

<p>Girlie’s mind was a chaos as her scared eyes met the
implacable ones that were fixed on hers. General damnation
was their only portent. She knew she was done
for, anyway. It was but a question of putting off the
evil day. But if she bolted now she would at least save
herself from being publicly found out, whereas if she
waited for the inevitable exposure there was no saying
what might happen to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but I daren’t let him propose&mdash;I simply
daren’t.”</p>

<p>Elfreda harshly told her not to be foolish.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;-!” Girlie knew only too well that her wriggles
were miserably inadequate. And in the midst of
them yet another complication presented itself. She
remembered that there might be two Richmonds in the
field. Signs had not been wanting that the little baronet
also was inclined to view her with a favorable eye.
Certain cadences of his voice lingered in her ears even
now. There seemed but one thing to do. As one seeking
the aid of a strength beyond her own she confessed
to Elfreda that Sir Toby Philpot also might be on the
verge of a proposal.</p>

<p>To this admission Elfreda did not immediately reply.
But with that pitiless glance that had the power
of striking far below the surface of things, she looked
at the Deputy. Was this the kind of little idiot who
believes that every man who smiles as he opens a door
is in love with her, or was it literally true that at Clavering
Park she was <i>un succès fou</i>? Elfreda continued
to analyze her mercilessly. Yes, in her way, she was
undoubtedly a pretty little thing. And the half-scared
manner and the timid voice made her rather a plaintive,
rather a pathetic little thing, so that after all it would
not be so very remarkable if she made a strong appeal
to the male. At the same time, the idea of her playing
such havoc was ludicrous and, from Elfreda’s own
private standpoint, more than a little humiliating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Here was the richest possible commentary on the
sort of people whom her own parents considered good
enough for her. Had fuel been needed to sustain Elfreda’s
fighting spirit it was here in abundance. If
only for pure devilment now she would go on with the
farce. An odd sparkle in her eyes must have proclaimed
her intention, for at the mere sight of it the
hapless Deputy gave one further gasp.</p>

<p>“Oh, please&mdash;please, do come back with me and put
things right!”</p>

<p>Girlie would have done as well to have appealed to
a stone. “No, not yet.” There was not a hint of compromise.
“You must keep it up&mdash;until after Tuesday
at any rate. I will come to you one day next week,
perhaps Wednesday or Thursday. And if you will do
your best and stand it as well as you can, no harm
shall come to you. I promise that.”</p>

<p>It was meager comfort. But to judge by Elfreda’s
eyes there was no hope just then of anything else. Be
the cost what it might her decision was made. Poor
Girlie clung for support to an arm of the sofa. Sheer
beneath her feet yawned a chasm.</p>

<p>As if to intensify this grim illusion Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
chose that moment to return to the drawing
room. Her return, moreover, was fraught with purpose.
“Lady Elfreda.” So flutelike was the lady of
the house that the new governess could not help wondering
privately how her voice would have sounded at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>the Queen’s Hall!&mdash;“Won’t you stay to luncheon? We
shall be <i>so</i> glad if you will.”</p>

<p>The answer of the distinguished visitor was to regard
the new governess with a scared and apprehensive
eye. But that lady was quite equal to the situation.
She turned to Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson and said
with a kind of frigid decision that forbade any possible
doubt, “Lady Elfreda is expected for luncheon
at Clavering Park.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, in a manner that left no loophole for
argument, Miss Cass moved to the drawing room door
and opened it. As her eyes drew Girlie towards it
they seemed full of a latent menace. The visitor was
just able to muster a half audible “Good-by. Thank you
so much,” for the benefit of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson,
before she was sternly shepherded if not actually hustled
by Elfreda across the hall.</p>

<p>“Do your best. Don’t be afraid. I will let you
know the day I can come next week. And remember
that I take all responsibility.” Amid this spate of final
low-toned instructions poor Girlie was put out on to
the gravel and the front door of The Laurels closed
rather peremptorily upon her.</p>

<p>From behind the drawing room curtains Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson watched the slight form of the
visitor fade from view along the carriage drive. A
tempest raged in the bosom of the lady of the house.
If the manner of Miss Cass meant anything she looked
down upon her employer; her arbitrary dismissal of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>the luncheon project could bear no other interpretation.
However, the fury of the storm was a little assuaged
by a wholesome curiosity; otherwise it might have gone
hard with Miss Cass. Not only was that amazing
person called upon by the aristocracy, but her attitude
towards it was that of one who claims a half scornful
equality. She had no more respect for Lady Elfreda
Catkin than she had for any one else!</p>

<p>There was balm in that thought. For several days
past Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had been at the point of
telling the new governess that she would not suit, and
of advertising for some one else. Indeed, for the sake
of General Norris and dear Dolores, she had been
obliged to ask Miss Cass to dine upstairs. But even
now Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson could not quite bring
herself to give that lady notice. She was far too interesting;
in fact a type of governess altogether new
in her present employer’s rather chequered experience.
The children hated her, but she might be good for
them. She would be able to teach them self-assurance.</p>

<p>Taking one consideration with another, Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson still shrank from the drastic step
of giving Miss Cass her congé. She would wait, at
any rate, until she had told the story to Dolores.
Whether she would take the advice of Dolores and get
rid of her, that, of course, was the point to decide.
Poor dear Dolores loathed Miss Cass.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXI">XXI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y</span> the time that Girlie, homeward bound, had
reached the Pendennis Arms at Clavering, she
realized that even if the erratic vehicle which went by
the gates of the Park was prepared to start immediately,
luncheon would be over by the time she got back.
She made up her mind accordingly “to go the whole
hog,” and proceeded to regale herself with a cup of
tea and a war bun at an adjacent confectioner’s.
Then, after an hour’s inspection of the small and
sleepy town, she set her face towards her temporary
home.</p>

<p>She was in no hurry to get there. For one thing
she had to evolve some sort of excuse that would cover
the fact of her absence from the luncheon table. Again,
she had to decide the question whether it was absolutely
necessary to return at all. Why not bolt? It would
not be difficult. There was a little, only a very little
money in her purse, it was true. Should she accept
this as the price of her career? That was the question.
Just now almost anything seemed better than to return
and meet the public exposure which could not long be
delayed.</p>

<p>At a bend of the leaf-strewn road, where beyond a
rich expanse of park land the imposing chimneys of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>the Hall rose into view, she suddenly stopped to grapple
once again with this sore problem. Only too clearly
did she realize that flight was her only chance. As
far as she was concerned there could be no other solution.
It would be a base betrayal of Lady Elfreda,
yet Girlie saw now with painful clearness that her new
acquaintance was far too dangerous to be regarded as
a friend.</p>

<p>The young woman masquerading at The Laurels
was entitled to such small consideration that Girlie felt
she could square her conscience on that point at least.
But now that her thoughts were centered upon running
away, she was met by the fact that she had
given up her rooms at Laxton, that she had lost her
situation, that she had nowhere to go. In the lee of the
park wall there followed a tense five minutes of mental
conflict. In the end it may have been her odd strain
of megalomania that decided the question. Certainly
that fatal flaw had much to answer for. Let her rise
to the height of opportunity! Let her not be afraid of
life, but drink bravely of the cup of high experience!</p>

<p>Finally, swayed no doubt by these perilous ideas, she
passed on by the park wall and through the lodge gates.
Defiant of fate and all its machinations, she went
straight to her room to tidy herself for tea. In the
act of doing so she could not help marveling at her own
cynicism. It was so incredible that she could not recognize
herself. While she changed her dress and rearranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
her hair she began to evolve some sort of a
story to cover her absence. As soon as she appeared
in the hall she had, of course, to run the gauntlet.</p>

<p>“My dear Lady Elfreda,” cried the yellow chrysanthemum
lady at the pitch of humorous expostulation,
“where <i>have</i> you been?”</p>

<p>Girlie hardened her heart. “Into Clavering.” Her
courage rose to a dogged defiance. “To do some shopping.
I am so sorry. I ought to have told you.”</p>

<p>“But your luncheon?” Mrs. Minever’s face was a
study. “Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“At a tea shop.”</p>

<p>The half amused eyes of the hostess suddenly encountered
those of Mrs. Spencer-Jobling. Among her
fellow guests the theory was growing that not only
was Lady Elfreda suffering from a queer form of
“side” but also that she was a little “cracked.” Certainly
her manner was most odd and her behavior
matched it.</p>

<p>Girlie, however, was now at bay. She took her seat
in the midst of her critics, sipped tea and pecked at
bread and butter. Never in her life had she felt so
wretched. The affair was getting unbearable. As she
suffered the rather scathing politeness of Mrs. Spencer-Jobling
and the icy tones of the other ladies her mind
ran upon suicide. But the demon within bade her
go on. There was Shelley’s authority that what poets
learn in suffering they teach in song. Of novelists, no
doubt, that maxim was equally true.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> ladies were still drinking tea when a footman
ushered in a visitor.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lancelot.”</p>

<p>The elderly mistress of Amory Towers aroused the
curiosity of even the professional <i>blasèes</i> who greeted
her. She was “County.” They might seem to scorn
her in the way they scorned all things and everybody,
their veiled amusement had a touch of malice no doubt,
but there was also Mrs. Lancelot’s faculty of engaging
the interest of all the world and his wife to be reckoned
with.</p>

<p>She was like nothing upon this earth&mdash;the yellow
chrysanthemum lady, Mrs. Spencer-Jobling and Mrs.
Conrad Jones were agreed upon that!&mdash;yet in her queer
way the old dame stood for something. What she
stood for was, no doubt, a bygone phase. She might
have stepped out of a page of Punch for the year 1890.
Her dress with its decided waist and its antediluvian
tuckers round wrist and neck was of amethyst colored
merino, a necklet of amethyst hung upon her ample
chest, her hair with a Queen Alexandra fringe was
barber’s blocked after the manner of royalty, her toque
baffled all description, but it had pansies in it, and her
manner, plain and practical rather than “grand,” carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
a weight that her odd appearance should have countervailed,
yet somehow failed to do so. Mrs. Lancelot,
no doubt, was <i>une figure pour rire</i>, but only those very
accomplished in the world could have got her “range”
with a nicety sufficient to take advantage of the fact.
Her present critics, for example, inclined to scorn as
they were, could not help being fettered a little by a
secret sense of their own inadequacy.</p>

<p>A dutiful neighbor, Mrs. Lancelot had called once
on the yellow chrysanthemum lady and the call had
been promptly returned. There, however, the intercourse
had ceased. Somehow they had hardly set each
other’s genius. But this afternoon there was no hint
of that fact in Mrs. Lancelot’s entrance or of Mrs.
Minever’s reception of her. The visitor was cautious,
almost comically cautious, as she always was when not
quite sure of her bearings; the yellow chrysanthemum
lady was slightly more exuberant than usual, as she
was apt to be when cherishing a similar doubt on her
own part. In the sight of Mrs. Spencer-Jobling,
rather declassèe daughter of a not undistinguished sire,
it was as good as a play to see them together: this
resolute survivor of a discredited phase of human history&mdash;the
august visitor’s relations had held more than
one job about the court of Victoria the Good&mdash;and the
forthcoming hostess who made no secret of the fact
that she was bored by “frills” and “fine shades.”</p>

<p>The reason of Mrs. Lancelot’s visit to Clavering
Park, if not immediately clear, was soon revealed. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>discerning but imperious eye fixed itself upon Girlie,
who, seated a little apart from the others in a bergère
chair, was feeling a strong desire to take cover inside
her tea cup.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lancelot took a vacant chair by her side and
began to converse in a low, intimate tone.</p>

<p>“You are not at all like your mother.” Mrs. Lancelot’s
direct mode of attack made Girlie tremble. “You
are not like your father, either. You look rather tired,
my dear.”</p>

<p>The Deputy mumbled a brief denial, which unfortunately
was quite inaudible.</p>

<p>“Are you feeling tired?”</p>

<p>Girlie had the presence of mind to say that she had
been working very hard at the rehearsals.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t work too hard. You look quite run down.”
And then Mrs. Lancelot proceeded energetically, “You
must come over to us, my dear. A change will do you
good. I have written to your mother to tell her. We
are very old friends, your mother and I&mdash;old school-fellows,
in fact&mdash;and, of course, third cousins once removed.
You must come at once. I am sure you need
a change and Ethel thinks so, too.”</p>

<p>Little shivers began to trickle down Girlie’s spine.
She was in no mood to exchange the ills she knew for
the ills she could only surmise, for, as she realized,
these might so easily prove the more terrible.</p>

<p>“Yes, you must come to us.” In the saurian aspect
of Mrs. Lancelot there was something quite alarming.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>“Your mother would like it. Now, when shall it be?”</p>

<p>The prospect of a visit to Amory Towers reduced
Girlie to a frozen silence. A look of fear came in her
eyes. Mrs. Lancelot was not one to notice subtleties
of any kind, but, happily, the yellow chrysanthemum
lady, as soon as she learned what was in the wind, did
not hesitate to come to the rescue of her guest. For
one thing, the daughter of Lord Carabbas, with all her
limitations, was the undoubted <i>pièce de resistance</i> of
the house party; and Mrs. Minever was inclined to accept
Lady Elfreda’s reluctance as an unexpected compliment
to the life she was leading at Clavering Park.
Heaven knew what was passing through the odd creature’s
mind, but if those scared eyes and that rather
hunted look had any meaning, it was clear enough that
she infinitely preferred Clavering Park to Amory
Towers!</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Lady Elfreda can’t be spared&mdash;until
after the performance on Tuesday, at any rate.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Minever’s boldness was rewarded by a look
of pure gratitude, but also it incurred the penalty of
an almost truculent, “Why not, pray?” from the august
visitor.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” the yellow chrysanthemum lady
stoutly rejoined, “so many rehearsals will be necessary
between now and Tuesday. Sir Toby Philpot says
everything is so behind hand that as soon as Mr. Jupp
arrives they will have to go on all day.”</p>

<p>These sinister words fell upon Girlie like a sword.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>She was between the devil and the deep, deep sea.
Paralysis of will was added now to her other miseries.
On the verge of collapse, she sank back in her chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lancelot, however, was not to be put off. She
was a lady who liked her own way, and on most occasions
was accustomed to get it. But on this occasion
she had to submit to a compromise. Lady Elfreda
must come to Amory Towers, but her visit should be
deferred until Tuesday the-all-important was safely
over.</p>

<p>“Wednesday, then&mdash;let us say Wednesday,” said the
august visitor.</p>

<p>The yellow chrysanthemum lady promised that
Wednesday it should be, while Girlie smiled weakly.
Mrs. Lancelot, having carried her point more or less,
graciously accepted a cup of the fresh tea that had been
procured for her. Perhaps, by the light of later events,
it had been better for Girlie had she not done so. For
Mrs. Lancelot, before taking her leave, proceeded to
harrow the souls of her hearers. She had a sinister
tale to unfold. A gang of thieves were at work in the
neighborhood. The Channings had had the Priory
ransacked while they were at dinner, and poor Lady
Emily had suffered the loss of a most valuable diamond
pendant. There had also been a most suspicious
parlor-maid at the Towers, but luckily she had been
sent away before anything of real value had been
missed. But Major Hocking, the chief constable,
thought the gang so dangerous that Mrs. Lancelot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>had been advised to send her jewels and some of her
silver to the bank, and she had accordingly done so.</p>

<p>“I tell you this, Mrs. Minever,” said the visitor in
her most <i>affairé</i> tone, “because in such times as these
one cannot be too careful.”</p>

<p>The yellow chrysanthemum lady thought the remark
very sensible and expressed her gratitude for the information.
It confirmed the rumors she had heard. On
the other hand, Mrs. Spencer-Jobling was inclined to
think that all stories of the kind were apt to be exaggerated,
but Mrs. Lancelot rent her at once with chapter
and verse.</p>

<p>“No, after the experience of the Channings one
should really take every precaution.” And with a
rather elaborate leave-taking of Lady Elfreda, and one
more informal of people less exalted, Mrs. Lancelot
augustly went her way.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIII">XXIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">G</span>irlie</span> took a long while to array herself for that
evening’s dreaded meal. The crisis of her fate
was now at hand. Realizing to the full all that was
involved in the coming of Mr. Montagu Jupp, she had
not the courage to ask Mrs. Minever whether that Old
Man of the Sea was really on the point of arrival.
Only too soon would the fact be known. In her present
state of mind she was quite unable to face the dire consequences
that must attend his visit; she chose, therefore,
to bury her head ostrich-wise in sand by indulging
the pitifully vain hope that he was not coming
after all.</p>

<p>How frail that hope was the momentous hour of
eight revealed very surely. Hardly had she entered
the drawing room, striving heroically for a show of
composure which her wretched nerves denied her,
when lo! amid a cascade of chaff with an undercurrent
of laughter and applause, the great and admired Montagu
came in his own person upon the scene.</p>

<p>Sir Toby, as usual, led the way. It was his fixed
rule of life to lead the way everywhere, under all conditions,
in all circumstances, if only he was allowed
to do so. At the back of his mind he always seemed
to feel that the stars in their courses had ordained that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>he should be the master of every ceremony. But, in
comparison with the mountain of geniality who
alternately rolled and grinned as he followed in his
wake, Sir Toby was the merest pigmy. Mr. Jupp had
the art of monopolizing the attention of all the world,
of catching every eye, of dominating every assembly
he entered.</p>

<p>Still, the mere arrival of the great man was in the
nature of a triumph for Sir Toby. Odds had been
freely laid by despondent members of the cast that
Montagu would not appear. But his magnetic presence
was just what was needed to “pull things together.”
However, as far as the luckless leading lady was concerned,
no one envied him his task.</p>

<p>Quite a thrill seemed to pervade the air of the drawing
room at the moment of their greeting. But Girlie,
in the toils of sheer desperation, was able for once to
muster an inhuman stoicism. Already she had undergone
so much that she was now determined to die fighting.
Yes, whatever happened, she would die fighting.
Heroically, with bright eyes, with set lips, she came
forward a pace, as the hostess triumphantly convoyed
the great man towards her. “How do you do?” she
said, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>The sublime Original, who at that fell moment was
consuming cold mutton and mixed pickles in the outer
darkness of the nursery at The Laurels, whither she
had been banished in disgrace, could not have “played
up” better. Mr. Jupp, a little fatigued by travel and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>with a forward looking mind in regard to his dinner,
bowed over the hand that was offered. He did not
scrutinize the little lady closely, at any rate just then.
He took it for granted that she was what she was. Besides,
apart from the fact that the clock on the chimney
piece had already struck eight, there was a reason,
known only to himself, why he should be in no hurry
to traverse the personality of Lady Elfreda Catkin,
much less to challenge her identity.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, and the dark secret was locked securely
in the bosom of Mr. Montagu Jupp, he had only met
Lady Elfreda once, for a few brief moments, so that
the faculty of observation not being his long suit, he
was not so clear as he might have been as to what she
really looked like. The skeleton in Montagu’s cupboard
which some of his friends, the malicious Garden
to wit, shrewdly suspected to be the case, was that
he was inclined “to talk through his hat”; in other
words, he was prone to claim an intimacy with all the
world that the crude facts did not always justify. He
had said once in Sir Toby’s hearing over an after-dinner
whisky and cigar, that “he had taught Lady
Elfreda Catkin all the acting she knew,” but that incautious
statement had been less in response to sober
truth than to her highly effective portrait in the <i>Society</i>
Pictorial. It was sufficient for <i>un homme du monde</i>
that he had talked with her once for five minutes at a
garden party. The fact was typical of the man, even
a part of his picturesqueness, but at this moment, had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>the luckless Girlie been aware of it, here was a card
incredibly in her favor.</p>

<p>Girlie, alas, did not know that. She went in to dinner
and took her accustomed place at the right hand of
the host with a growing conviction that she was about
to be hanged in public, to say nothing of the drawing
and quartering to follow. She felt it was only a question
of minutes before Mr. Jupp denounced her. Every
time her guilty eye strayed furtively across to his side
of the table she perceived his eye, in its degree hardly
less guilty, furtively upon her. But she did not know,
she could not guess the strength of her own position.
She could only marvel as course succeeded course, as
her wine glass grew empty and then grew full again,
that the inevitable thunderbolt did not descend.</p>

<p>As the meal went on and exposure grew ever more
imminent in the mind of the Deputy&mdash;a dramatic scene
was surely reserved for the drawing room!&mdash;she grew
increasingly bold. After her glass had been replenished
three times she did not care what happened. She
would die “game.” This was her very last hour of
vicarious splendor, but she had now an intense desire
to live it to the full. Her tongue was loosened, her
laugh rose higher and more frequent, her eyes grew
wonderfully bright. All this harmonized with the spirit
of the others, for, as usual, Mr. Jupp had brought an
infectious gayety upon the scene. Everybody laughed
at everybody else; all were in a mood of festive enjoyment;
the almost perilous light-heartedness of “the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Catkin puss” excited no comment&mdash;or, if it did, it
counted to her for virtue. Certainly her host, who for
a week now had endured “heavy cake” with a noble
fortitude, was charmed by the change. There might
be something in the little noodle after all.</p>

<p>When dinner was over other people began to think
so, too. Living in the very crater of Vesuvius with
an eruption long overdue, keyed up beyond a self that
was rather undercharged, for the first time in her life
Girlie let herself go. Somehow it seemed the only
course to take. Amid the hilarity the mere presence
of Mr. Jupp had induced, that remarkable man sat
down at the piano and began to do it considerable
violence. Thereupon one of the younger “bloods”
began to fox-trot with Mrs. Spencer-Jobling. Sir
Toby Philpot, not to be outdone, immediately commandeered
the hostess, Mr. Minever promptly laid
siege to another lady, and then Girlie grew alive to the
fact that Lord Duckingfield was smiling at her and
moving resolutely in her direction.</p>

<p>“Just show me how to&mdash;won’t you, my dear?” His
voice was wonderfully persuasive and fatherly.</p>

<p>Girlie’s knowledge of the fox-trot was almost as
vague as my lord’s. But what did that matter? What
did anything matter? She rose with a laugh, she intertwined
one slender arm with his; slowly she gyrated
with this performing bear of a man twice round the
drawing room, and then in the wake of the more enterprising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
couples through the open door and out into the
hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Jupp continued to pound the piano. Tango succeeded
fox-trot, there was an occasional relapse to the
two-step, a brief intermission of some forgotten waltz
or other, with now and again, as became a truly modern
and progressive mind, a heroic attempt at the jazz.
None of the dancers obeyed the music; they didn’t
really try to do so; each chose the style that seemed
the most natural, so that what began as a half serious
performance soon degenerated into an amazing go-as-you-please.
But it was highly enjoyable. At any rate,
Lord Duckingfield thought it was. A strenuous youth
in factory and warehouse had left him no time to pay
court to Terpsichore. He knew what he liked, however.
And what he did like was to wheel slowly and
solemnly round on his left foot, with plenty of elbow
room and without having too much ground to cover.
And if he was most agreeably assisted in these maneuvers
by the charmingly pretty bearer of a distinguished
name, why so much the better.</p>

<p>This dainty, gray-eyed little girl quite set the genius
of my lord. She was so simple. And with all his
riches and his ambitions and his recent nobility, at
heart he was really simple himself. After a most exhilarating
twenty minutes on the hall parquet, in a
space hardly more than six feet square, in the course
of which Girlie, with the inimitable tact of her sex,
contrived neatly to fit step for step, Lord Duckingfield
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>espied a corner almost perilous in its charm and its
seclusion in an angle of the stairs. In point of fact he
had had his eye on it from the first. By the time he
had truly earned a rest he felt that it would come to
him as the just reward of his merit and his virtue.</p>

<p>In the room adjacent, on a piano whose extreme resonance
was almost unbearable, Mr. Jupp continued
to do surprising things, while his fellow guests, each
after his or her manner, kept pace with him as far as
was humanly possible. At last, however, Lord Duckingfield
came to a sudden halt and drew a series of deep
breaths. Then, Girlie upon his arm, he made a bee-line
for the palm-shrouded alcove beneath the hall stairs.
Kindly providence had decreed that two chairs, of the
sort called “comfortable,” should be there already.
Girlie, a little breathless too after her altruistic exertions,
found herself at rest in one a brief ten seconds
before her cavalier came to anchor in the other.</p>

<p>She was feeling entirely reckless. She didn’t care.
Her limit had been reached, nay, it had been overstepped.
She would drink of the cup. Life was dancing
a fiery symbol before her eyes. In spite of the
sword that hung by a thread in mid-air she was enjoying
her hour. She was enjoying it terribly. If
she died of the shame that must follow, at least she
would be able to point to an experience beyond the run
of women.</p>

<p>“Nice of you, my dear, to help an old duffer like
me.” The rich, half chuckling tone of Lord Duckingfield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
had an odd humility that was wonderfully attractive
in the ear of a woman.</p>

<p>“Not at all.” Softly she lisped in true Galsworthian
phrase. A powerful genius enfolded her. With a
kind of mad dignity she sat up in the wicker chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is, though,” My lord was heavily serious
for all that there was a kind of elephantine humor in
him. “Not many of you smart young ladies would be
bothered with a clumsy old fool like me.”</p>

<p>“But you are not clumsy&mdash;you are not at all clumsy,”
It was not the speech of a smart young lady, it was
not true, it was not subtle, above all, it was unworthy
of the author of “The Patrician,” and by the light of
the inner mind she knew this only too well, but the
stage-manager of the pleasant little comedy understood
the business better than did she. The crude simplicity
for which she could have wept at the moment her lips
betrayed it, really met the situation exactly. In spite
of her lineage&mdash;or perhaps because of it&mdash;Lord Duckingfield
was more than ever convinced that she was a
very nice little girl.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, and his abrupt fall to an almost
disconcerting intimacy was the truest compliment such
a highly practical man could have paid her, “you see,
I don’t pretend to be one of the fancy sort. No Eton
and Oxford for me. At your age, my dear, I was earning
my thirty shillings a week at the carpenter’s bench
and thinking myself almighty lucky to be getting it.”</p>

<p>She actually had the wit to reward the reminiscence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>with a ripe Galsworthian “Really!” But again she must
have fallen short of the rich quality of her mentor,
since my lord went on, for all the world as if she had
not been a marquis’s daughter, “You don’t know, my
dear, what I’ve had to fight against. Most of you
young ladies laugh at men like me, but you are one of
the sensible kind, so that’s why I don’t mind telling you
of my early life.”</p>

<p>The gray eyes smiled at Lord Duckingfield. And as
the stage-manager had fixed an electric bulb at a psychological
angle midway between the two chairs, so that
its rays caught the light of those eyes and set it dancing,
Lord Duckingfield was suddenly and acutely
aware of quite the sharpest thrill he had ever experienced.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m very rich now.” Lord Duckingfield
seemed inclined to carry naïveté to the verge of indelicacy.
“Very rich indeed. Your father will make allowances
for that. But you are such a very nice little
girl that even had you been just plain Miss Brown....”</p>

<p>With a shiver, half enchantment, half dismay, Girlie
realized that a sympathetic hand had put forth from
the adjacent chair and that it was exquisitely enclosing
hers. The close-breathing pause which followed must
have meant embarrassment for both, had either been
in a condition to respond to that form of emotion. But
Girlie had burnt her boats. She was past all caring.
As for Lord Duckingfield he was now suddenly alive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>to the fact that he was quite in love with this pretty
gray-eyed mouse.</p>

<p>“You are so sensible.” The grip tightened upon the
slender arm. “There’s no nonsense about you. If you
don’t mind my saying so you are not at all like most
of the smart girls I’ve met. They are so knowing.
And they take so much living up to&mdash;for an old duffer
like me. Give me something homely and sensible.” Inch
by inch the wicker chair came closer. She felt one arm,
half chivalrous, half masterful, slowly encircle her.</p>

<p>She made no effort to repel this audacity. Somehow
it marched with her own state of mind. But in the
next moment something had happened, something
which had the effect of bringing her up short in the
midst of her folly and incidentally of summoning her
northern forbears primly upon the scene. Lord
Duckingfield took her in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>It was the first time in Girlie’s life of twenty years
that such a thing had happened or had seemed likely
to happen. Nothing could have been more subversive
of her strait “high-brow” code than to be kissed by a
man, and a rather elderly man, without so much as
a by-your-leave, in circumstances of semi-publicity.
Even if she had a sense of having dined, deep down
she knew it to be an epic moment; she was thrilled as
she had never been thrilled; it was the event of her life.
He might be a real live peer of the realm; all the same
his boldness was just a little too much for Miss Cass
of Laxton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>Involuntarily she stiffened, involuntarily she drew
her chair a few paces away from him. Slightly
abashed but wholly impenitent Lord Duckingfield followed
her. But Miss Cass of Laxton was not quite
lost to a sense of her high destiny. What kind of man
was this! How dare he! She must let him know that
this was not the form of a budding Charlotte Brontë.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, as soon as the mild
horror in her eyes had convicted him. He spoke so
nicely, so gently, that it was not in her heart to be
angry even had it been in her nature to be so.</p>

<p>He proved the depth of his contrition by a sudden
descent into autobiography. His early life was unfolded
before her, his struggles, his defeats, his slow
ascent of fortune’s ladder. She could not help admiring
this large simplicity, she could not help honoring
him for it, but when she perceived that it was leading
all-too-surely to what she feared, but by another road,
she was overcome. She began to steel herself to bear
the blow she had more than half invited.</p>

<p><i>Don’t let me see you or hear from you again until
he has proposed to you.</i> Those grim words, brutal and
incredible, came upon her ears for the hundredth time.
Was she weakly to yield to such cynicism! If a spark
of human decency remained to her, she must avert
while there was yet time that which too clearly was
going to happen.</p>

<p>Spurred to action by a cruel desperation, she rose
abruptly. But that did not serve. Lightly, but firmly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>Lord Duckingfield grabbed her by the wrist and propelled
her with half whimsical precision back to her
chair. The deed was accomplished with a kind of humorous
deftness, but the “insight” of Miss Cass might
have told her, had she been able just then to bring it
into play, that the seeming archness of her suitor was
a mere mask. Really he was possessed by a most becoming
nervousness and this a lady of her powers
ought to have divined. Perhaps she did divine it.
Underneath Lord Duckingfield’s humor was a fitting
sense of presumptuous audacity. He, at least, in spite
of his democratic sense, could not forget who she was.
What more likely than that being a thoroughly clumsy
fellow he had already gone too far.</p>

<p>“Lady Elfreda.” His voice&mdash;his deep voice&mdash;sounded
rather hoarse. “I want you to help me if you
can. I’m in love with you, as I never thought I could
be in love with any girl. You are just my sort. I
think we understand one another. I am sure I can
make you happy. Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>The moment had come. She had but herself to
blame. Hers the sole fault that the thing had happened.
The blunt words of one whom she was quite
sure was a good and simple man fell upon her like a
douche. They were like a douche of ice-cool reason.
In that instant she saw that this wicked madness must
cease. No matter what the cost she must forget her
miserable self. Such a horrid farce could not go on.</p>

<p>She felt his honest grip upon her fingers. The pause
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>that followed became more than she could bear. If
ever she was to respect herself again, here and now
she must make an end. Desperately she assembled the
fugitive fragments of her will, but the very stars in
their courses were against her now. One phrase, one
unforgettable phrase he had used was running like
quicksilver in her brain. “You are such a very nice
little girl that even had you been just plain Miss
Brown...!”</p>

<p>Fatal corollary! She was “just plain Miss Brown”
had he but known it. Therefore, as his own words
proved, where could be the purpose of his knowing it?
The argument was too sweetly specious! Torn as she
was, she had not the strength to fight it. Half-heartedly
she strove to overcome the spell of those
fatal words, but she knew only too well that the task
was hopeless.</p>

<p>“Think it over, my dear.” He was no longer nervous;
he was calm, precise, matter of fact. “I’m not so
young as I might be, but anything that money can buy
I am in a position to give you. No need for an
answer just now. I see you want time to think it
over&mdash;it’s only proper and natural. But to-morrow I
hope you’ll be able to tell me that I may write to your
father.”</p>

<p>Again, with an increasing horror, Girlie felt the kiss
of an honest man upon her shrinking finger tips.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o</span> bed&mdash;to dream, but not to sleep. The situation
that shaped itself so fantastically to Girlie’s
mind in the tardy hours of a long and wakeful night
was almost more than she could bear. Here was the
last straw. Playing with human souls is a perilous
game. In drifting at another’s bidding into such a
position she had not reckoned upon the cost to herself.
She was not of the stuff of which the real adventuress
is made. The whole affair was really an outrage upon
her deepest instincts. She had neither the cynicism,
the native impudence nor “the sense of the theater” to
keep the thing going. Somewhere about the hour of
four, when the night was at its darkest and her courage
was very low, she resolved to make an end. With remorse
inflicting such torments upon her there seemed
nothing else to do. She spent the rest of the night
feverishly planning a way out. None there was, alas,
that could hope to spare her the tragic weight of humiliation,
and worse than humiliation she had so
honestly earned; but as far as possible she must defend
herself against a public exposure.</p>

<p>Until getting-up time came she strove with this
problem. But she was caught in a trap from which
there was no escape. Daylight stealing into the cell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>of the condemned could not have been more unwelcome
than the faint rose of dawn creeping through the
blinds of King Edward’s bedroom. Girlie did not
know how to face another day. The matutinal cup of
tea, brought to her at eight o’clock by a very trim
housemaid, found her in an abject state of “nerves.”
She had reached the conclusion by this time that her
only hope lay in immediate flight. By some miracle
Mr. Jupp had not yet denounced her, but she felt sure
it could only be a question of hours. And even if the
miracle went on and he still refrained from doing so,
the position into which she had allowed herself to drift
with Lord Duckingfield was quite unendurable. She
was now haunted by the thought of this good and simple
man for whom she had a real regard.</p>

<p>Yes, she must get away. But where could she go?
To The Laurels? Only too clearly did she realize
that there was nothing to hope for from that quarter&mdash;at
any rate if she flagrantly disobeyed her instructions.
Besides in her present state of mental and
moral weakness she really went in fear of her Evil
Genius.</p>

<p>After a time her mind began to run upon an aunt
in Scotland. Now that she had wantonly forfeited
her only means of getting a living, that austere dame,
an elder sister of her mother’s, whom she remembered
but faintly, was the only relation or friend to whom
she could turn. Her recollection of Aunt Alice was
dim and it was not agreeable. Aunt Alice lived a long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>way off, she was the wife of a struggling doctor with
a large family of her own, and the best her niece could
hope for was an astonished and grudging welcome.
Still there seemed no alternative now.</p>

<p>Wrought upon by the need for action, Girlie got out
of bed and took her purse from the left hand drawer
of the dressing table. In a state of nervous excitement
she hunted for the address of Aunt Alice. Presently
she was rewarded with the sight of an old letter bearing
the postmark “Inverness.” Her heart sank. She
knew nothing of Inverness, except that it was somewhere
in the north of Scotland.</p>

<p>Further examination of the inside of the purse revealed
that her means of getting to Inverness amounted
to just two pounds, five shillings and ninepence. Such
a meager sum, even if it allowed her to get so far,
which at the present cost of travel was very doubtful,
would provide absolutely nothing to live upon. That
fact alone seemed to make the project hopeless. For
one weak instant, in the face of this rebuff, her mind
reverted to Lady Elfreda’s jewels, to which she had
access. But the thought&mdash;if thought it could be called&mdash;was
at once dismissed. Not for a moment could
any scheme of that kind be entertained. All the same
she indulged in a forlorn little sigh as the fact came
home to her once more that nature had not designed
her for the adventuress <i>pur sang</i>.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of such a lack of means her mind
continued to run upon Inverness. Throughout an uncomfortable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
appetiteless breakfast the thought of that
distant haven obsessed her. She managed to nibble a
piece of toast under the eye of the attentive and solicitous
Lord Duckingfield, who had so assiduously helped
her to this simple fare with a comment upon its meagerness.
This morning, as every morning, he was the
soul of kindness and courtesy. But she was quite
unable to talk to him; in fact, she did not dare to look
in his direction. It was a great relief when at last
she was able to carry Bradshaw to the good log fire
in the hall.</p>

<p>There, upon the scene of the previous evening’s
tragi-comedy she delved further into the problem of
transporting herself from Clavering St. Mary’s to the
north of Scotland.</p>

<p>One important fact in regard to a very long and
tortuous journey was soon established. The sum of
two pounds five shillings and ninepence rendered the
project hopeless.</p>

<p>Bradshaw in hand, she was still trying to meet a
not unexpected facer, when a voice of rather delicately
reproachful curiosity came from over her shoulder. It
was that of the hostess and Girlie felt a tremor of
guilty dismay.</p>

<p>“Not thinking of leaving us, are you, Lady Elfreda?”</p>

<p>Quickly and nervously Girlie replied that she was
not.</p>

<p>“Of course you’re not,” Mrs. Minever laughed. “Until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
after Tuesday at all events. You have only three
days now.” Mrs. Minever laughed a second time, perhaps
a shade sardonically. “How relieved you’ll be!
I am sure you have found us very dull. But when you
get to Amory Towers you’ll be able to play piquet with
Mrs. Lancelot. I hope you are a good player. Mrs.
Lancelot, I believe, is very proud of her piquet.”</p>

<p>The yellow chrysanthemum lady was a little inclined
to quiz. She was the soul of good nature, but Girlie’s
aloof detachment from her surroundings invited criticism.
The manner of the chief guest was so constrained,
so unnatural, that the only explanation was “side.”
Evidently this daughter of Lord Carabbas had such a
sense of her position that she did not find it easy to
mix with other people on terms of equality. Yet when
the worst had been said of the yellow chrysanthemum
lady she was really the least censorious of women. Besides,
she was not in a mood for chaff this morning,
no matter how fully it was deserved or how much the
occasion called for it. Mrs. Minever, in point of fact,
was graver this morning, more resolutely serious than
the guest had yet seen her. In Mrs. Minever’s own
words, “a very provoking thing had happened.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Mrs. Minever in a fluttered tone,
“you must please tell your maid to be sure and keep
your jewels under lock and key. One of my rings&mdash;a
rather valuable one&mdash;has disappeared. And you
heard what Mrs. Lancelot said yesterday? I’m afraid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>there is not the slightest doubt that a gang of burglars
is at work in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>Readily enough Girlie promised to keep her jewels
under lock and key.</p>

<p>“Of course it may be some one in the house. We
are always changing our servants. My husband is
consulting the police.”</p>

<p>Girlie’s heart sank. She did not need to be very
wise or very clever to foresee the bearing such a circumstance
would have upon her flight. If she bolted
now, without ostensible cause, the mere fact would be
terribly against her. Even as it was, when her imposture
was revealed, she felt sure it would go hard
with her; yet with these deeper grounds for even
blacker suspicion, she was likely to be faced with a
charge she was wholly unable to meet.</p>

<p>Her nerve was badly shaken, but this new turn of
events gave her a sudden distaste for the half-formed
plan. Beyond the crude fact that she simply lacked
the money to undertake the journey there was now an
even stronger reason why she should continue to stand
her ground.</p>

<p>All the same the standing of her ground promised
to be a soul testing process. It was by no means certain
that her courage would hold out. For one thing
the mere sight of Lord Duckingfield had the power to
involve her in a perfect orgy of conflicting emotions.
If the look of him, gravely polite, rather anxiously
formal, meant anything, he was clearly waiting for his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>answer. Why had she not had the strength of mind
to let him know the previous evening that he sought
the impossible? What was the good of having perceptions
and fine feelings, if one did not act in accordance
with them?</p>

<p>Then as if the unhappy affair of Lord Duckingfield
was not enough, there was the perennial question of
Mr. Montagu Jupp. Why he had not denounced her
already, heaven alone could tell!</p>

<p>The Deputy was far from suspecting the simple
truth that it had not yet begun to dawn upon Montagu
that this was not the lady he had met. Having drawn
the long bow so freely himself he was not able to
criticize her closely; his own impression of the youngest
girl of “old man Carabbas” was decidedly vague.
Still it was to be supposed that a whole day devoted to
the ill-starred “Lady of Laxton” would have done
much to enlighten him. As a matter of fact it did not.
For Girlie, at the nadir of her fortunes, was now inspired
with the courage of despair. Moved to a strange
recklessness by the sheer weight of her woes, she rose
beyond the level of herself.</p>

<p>This unexpected result was due in part, no doubt,
to Mr. Montagu Jupp. That gentleman certainly knew
his business. And at rehearsals he had a way with
him. Not only had he the art of smoothing tempers
and generally “oiling the wheels,” but the secret was
his also of evolving order out of chaos. The incompetence
of Sir Toby and the insubordination of several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>members of the cast had produced such a hopeless
tangle in the improvised theater in the east wing of
the house that for the time being even the inefficiency
of the leading lady had been overshadowed. But as
soon as Montagu set his hand to the plow “The Lady
of Laxton” took a decided turn for the better.</p>

<p>Very well that it was so. There were but three days
now to the performance in the Assembly Rooms at
Clavering, and by all the portents “the most dismal
fiasco of modern times,” in the gloomy and mordant
words of Garden was in prospect. But Montagu was
no common man. He had a faculty for “sizing things
up,” moreover he knew how to get them done. Privately
he was of opinion that Sir Toby’s masterpiece
beat all records in the way of sheer ineptitude, but wild
horses would not have dragged it out of him. Besides
he had been too long and too intimately associated
with the English theater in all its aspects to let a little
matter of that kind upset him. None knew better than
he what could be really achieved in the way of human
imbecility. And after all, as Montagu argued with
himself, the players were but a scratch company of
extremely amateurish amateurs, while the audience at
the best he described as “C3 Provincial.”</p>

<p>Girlie was not a “quick study,” but she was an extremely
conscientious one. Long hours of application
had made her absolutely word perfect in her part.
And there indeed she had a decided “pull” over the
others. Not one made the least pretence of being word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>perfect; several of them could hardly be said to have
looked at their lines. For instance, Mrs. Spencer-Jobling
was a particularly flagrant offender; but one
and all were animated by a robust conviction that “they
would be all right on the night”&mdash;in this case on Tuesday
afternoon.</p>

<p>By comparison with these temper-trying people,
Girlie shone. She really did know her words, and
although her manner of delivering them left much to
be desired, she was docile, intelligent, almost painfully
anxious to learn, so that on a first acquaintance and
superficially regarded, Mr. Jupp was inclined to consider
her “the pick of the lot.” But as he confided to
Garden, over a pre-luncheon cocktail, “She was not
exactly a Siddons.”</p>

<p>In truth, however, Mr. Jupp, although he was far
from guessing the fact, had already exercised a kind
of hypnotic influence upon the leading lady. His natural
gift “of bringing out the best in people” had had an
even greater effect upon Girlie than upon the less impressionable
members of the cast. Unconsciously she
had at once responded to the magnetic influence of this
king among “producers.” And yet the process may
not have been wholly unconscious after all.</p>

<p>The poor Deputy was at the end of her tether. Not
knowing which way to turn, not knowing what to do,
convinced that at any moment the fate she so richly
deserved must overtake her, she threw in all her reserves.
She abandoned herself entirely to the business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>of the hour. Not daring to look before or after, she
was like one under sentence of death. Before being
cast forever into outer darkness, her courage seemed
to make one last spasmodic flare.</p>

<p>In the course of that day there were two long rehearsals.
But Girlie threw so much spirit into her
acting and she was on such terms with the words of a
diffuse and thankless part, that for the time being her
tragic inefficiency was veiled. By comparison with the
casual, imperceptive, bored people whose duty it was
to play up to her, the leading lady actually shone.</p>

<p>“Yes, old bye&mdash;the best of the bunch,” Montagu
confided to the incredulous Garden over a well-earned
whisky and soda during an interval for tea. “Not saying
much of course. She can’t act for sour apples
but she does <i>try</i>.”</p>

<p>“But, my son”&mdash;Garden the incredulous, to whom
sooner or later all secrets were revealed, knew only
too well the weakness of his man&mdash;“that ass over there
said that you said this little filly could play all the
ingénues off the West End stage.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” Mr. Jupp spoke with the innocence of a
rather large size in cherubs, whom he so much resembled.</p>

<p>“You did.”</p>

<p>“Well, old bye,” Montagu fondled a pendulous chin,
“one says so many damn silly things in the course of
a lifetime, doesn’t one?”</p>

<p>Garden was fain to admit that it might be so, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>of all the foolishness ever perpetrated Montagu Jupp’s
original dictum upon Lady Elfreda’s acting was “the
terminus.”</p>

<p>All the same, to the general astonishment, including
that of Sir Toby that hardened optimist, by the end
of a long and strenuous day the stock of Lady Elfreda
was showing a decided tendency to rise. Those who
had worked with the leading lady at her worst, and a
pretty hopeless worst it had seemed, could not understand
the change. They resented the excellence of
her memory&mdash;she actually knew all her stupid words
by heart!&mdash;yet beyond everything else they resented
the new air of intelligence that had come upon her.</p>

<p>The spirit and the interest she had been able to display
in response to the demands of Mr. Montagu Jupp
told heavily against her now. The others bitterly recalled
her long week of silence, of indifference to her
fellow guests, of her strange ignorance of every subject
on which their tongues had run. They were now
forced to conclude that all this had been a pose. It
was a new form of “side.” Moreover it was a form so
subtle that it was very difficult to meet. Lady Elfreda’s
pretense of not knowing anything about anything was
pure affectation in the eyes of those whose aim in life
was to know everything about everything and not be
ashamed of saying so. And they would not be able to
forgive it. It was a subtle way of “scoring them off.”</p>

<p>“Sidey little cat, I hate her,” thus Mrs. Spencer-Jobling
in the depths of her heart. “Anyway, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>Tuesday, with a bit of luck, I think I ought to be able
to kill her big scene in the third act.”</p>

<p>A mad world! As soon as Lady Elfreda began to
show signs of leading her comrades out of the slough
of despond in which for a whole week they had been
engulfed, her unpopularity crystallized into virile personal
dislike. Henceforward, among the ladies of the
house party at any rate, she was never mentioned by
name; she was always referred to as the S. L. C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXV">XXV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ad</span> Girlie’s state of mind allowed her to enjoy
a sense of triumph, she might have fittingly indulged
it when dinner time approached. She had been
through a most severe ordeal and had emerged with
flying colors. Really, she had “kept up her end”
splendidly. How she had contrived to do so was more
than she could say; a latent genius must have taken
possession of her; but Mr. Montagu Jupp, that terrible
Old Man of the Sea whose arrival she had dreaded
beyond all things, whose mere appearance upon the
scene was to prove the last straw, had congratulated
her personally, if not exactly upon her acting, upon
her knowledge of her part. Moreover, she still lived.
Mr. Jupp, for some inexplicable reason, had not given
her away. He had addressed her several times as
“Lady Elfreda” without a hint of <i>arriére pensée</i>, and
in all good faith. And the praises of this remarkable
man had added so much to her prestige, that she was
quite sure that Mrs. Spencer-Jobling and the other
ladies were now furiously jealous.</p>

<p>Mr. Jupp’s attitude was so incomprehensible and
her own success so great a surprise to herself, that in
spite of everything she had a secret satisfaction when
she came to dress for dinner. But that emotion was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>brief. Hardly had the Deputy submitted herself to the
hands of Pikey when she learnt that the maid was in a
towering passion.</p>

<p>“What do you think?”&mdash;Grab!&mdash;“Me of all people”&mdash;Twist!&mdash;“I’ve
a mind to have the law of ’em”&mdash;Shake!&mdash;“So
I have”&mdash;Shake!</p>

<p>Thus the prelude. And the aria to follow was quite
as impressive.</p>

<p>It seemed that Mrs. Pike having been duly informed
that a diamond and sapphire ring was missing and
that the master of the house, although not knowing
whom to suspect, was consulting the police, had had
the singular ill-fortune to overhear two of the servants
discussing the matter. And in the course of the conversation
one of them had said “that she wouldn’t be
at all surprised if that old Marchioness had taken it.
Anyhow, she was quite sure that the Marchioness was
not quite right in her head.”</p>

<p>For several hours poor Pikey had brooded savagely
upon the implication. It was the deepest insult&mdash;second-hand
though it was&mdash;that she had ever received.
She hardly knew how to bear it. Even now, as she
prepared a bath for the Deputy, she was not at all
sure that she would not lodge a complaint with the
mistress of the house.</p>

<p>Such a reminder of the perils all around dashed
Girlie at once. The new sense of elation was nipped
before it had time to bloom. This unlucky disappearance
of the pearl necklace added very dark tints to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>picture, for when the inevitable exposure occurred it
was in the nature of things that suspicion would fall
upon herself. Even as it was Pikey was so incensed
by what she had heard that she was quite likely to court
disaster by making a fuss.</p>

<p>After a bath which was less enjoyable than it might
have been, Girlie did her best to combat this half-formed
resolution of the maid. Before doing so, however,
she gently but firmly took charge of the hairbrushes
and insisted upon applying them personally to
her own scalp. It needed courage, but it called for even
greater courage to allow Pikey to do her office in her
present savage mood.</p>

<p>A hairbrush in each hand, the Deputy begged the
Werewolf not to stir up strife unnecessarily. But
somehow the appeal did but minister to Pikey’s wrath.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll tell the mistress of the house.” The
Werewolf bared her fangs.</p>

<p>“If you do,” said the miserable Deputy, “everything
may come out.”</p>

<p>“I hope it does. I’m sick and tired of this.”</p>

<p>“But if it does come out, they are certain to suspect
me and I may have to go to prison.”</p>

<p>It was the falsest of all false moves. Girlie realized
the fact almost as soon as it was made. But this cruel
situation was always driving her too hard.</p>

<p>“So much the better if you do have to go to prison.”
Pikey’s words were scornful and deliberate. “I hope
you will, I’m sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>The callous speech took away Girlie’s breath. But
for the moment only. In the next she had unconsciously
proved that she was not the Girlie of a week ago.
“If you give me away”&mdash;the thin, high-pitched voice
quivered ominously&mdash;“and I do have to go to prison,
I’ll take good care, Mrs. Pike, that you come, too.”</p>

<p>The words gave pause to Mrs. Pike.</p>

<p>“They can’t touch me&mdash;not the police can’t,” she
said after a brief period of reflection. “I am not pretending
to be her ladyship. I am not pretending to be
any one.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not,” said Girlie. “But”&mdash;inspired by
the bizarre knowledge that may lurk in an out-of-the-way
corner of the brain of a solicitor’s daughter&mdash;“you
are an accessory after the fact, please don’t forget
that.”</p>

<p>The chance shot went home. Pikey was reduced to
savage mumblings. For the time being, at least, she
had met with her quietus.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVI">XXVI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> Girlie went down to dinner she was sustained
by a subtle feeling of inward power.
For the first time in her life she was upheld by perhaps
the most desirable of all human emotions. As she
entered the drawing room she caught the eye of Mr.
Montagu Jupp. And, miracle of miracles, it was an
approving eye. There was no doubt about that, since
Girlie belonged to the sex that does not make mistakes
in those little matters!</p>

<p>Yes, it was an approving eye. In the sight of Montagu
and his peers, when the little Catkin lady came
into the room timidly, with that rather hunted-fawn-look
in her gray eyes, with the slight flush in her cheeks
that went so well with the smart pink frock and the
twist of ribbon in her fluffy fair hair, she really was
a pretty little Puss. No wonder, thought the critics,
that the worthy Duckingfield was up against his fate.</p>

<p>His prolonged tête-a-tête the previous evening in the
alcove under the hall stairs had not passed without notice.
In fact, it had been commented upon very freely.
And while from the demeanor of my lord it was by no
means clear that his suit was prospering, his “dash”
was rather admired. That is to say, it was rather admired
by the members of his own sex, who are always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>apt to cherish that quality, particularly in one of their
middle-aged representatives. As far as the ladies were
concerned, however, they could see absolutely nothing
in the little noodle and they would not allow “that she
was even pretty.” Still the episode itself, the look of
my lord and the flush on the face of the S. L. C. lent
a touch of romance to the evening. And romance is
an elusive thing that is always welcome, even when
furnished by the lives of other people.</p>

<p>Dinner was almost hilarious. All agreed that the
great Montagu was beginning to do wonders already.
He had even contrived in his magnetic way to draw
a few sparks out of Lady Elfreda. This evening she
was like a new person. She was a thing of wreathed
smiles, of spasmodic giggles, and there could be no
doubt that her acting was improving. But it was Montagu
himself who was the key. He had his jest with
everybody. No one was safe from his chaff. He took
upon himself the rôle of the whimsical father of a
comically stupid family. No one resented his humor
although neither age nor sex was spared. He disparaged
the food and the wine, he complained that his
hostess was getting fat, he objected to the way in
which Mrs. Spencer-Jobling did her hair. Everybody
was sent into fits of laughter by his knack of saying
the things that are not said; but the audacious art with
which he masked their grim and sometimes brutal candor
left him perfect master of the field.</p>

<p>The amazing Montagu, to the delight of the others,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>even went to the length of asking Lord Duckingfield
“whether he had written yet to papa?” It was vain
for the stolid Midlander to assume an air of childlike
innocence. The table rocked with a laughter whose
volume seemed to imperil the wine glasses and the
crockery, when my lord was told that he had better
make haste and do so “or that little Perisher will get
there before you,” the statement being punctuated by
an accusing finger in the direction of Sir Toby.</p>

<p>The revels of the evening, of which a lively meal
was the prelude, were not perhaps the fine flowers of
taste, but that they were greatly enjoyed by all concerned
there could be no doubt. If exceptions there
were to the rule they were furnished by the Deputy
and Lord Duckingfield. Yet Lady Elfreda’s suitor
was too much a man of the world to mind particularly;
he may even have been rather flattered than otherwise
to find himself so famous; while, as for Girlie, having
been through so much and having so much more to go
through, she feasted and laughed bravely, so that when
the time came to retire to the drawing room with the
other ladies she felt that she simply didn’t care what
happened.</p>

<p>All the same, a brief withdrawal from the sphere of
influence of Mr. Montagu Jupp convinced the Deputy
that her fit of abandon was but temporary. Defenseless
in the drawing room, at the tender mercies of her
own sex, fear soon laid an icy finger upon her. So
resolutely did the other ladies give her the cold shoulder&mdash;even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
the hostess who had been so kind appeared for
some reason no longer her friend&mdash;that horrible doubts
flooded back into her mind. How much did they know?
What had they guessed? Suddenly Mrs. Spencer-Jobling
made a sinister reference to clever thieves who
got into smart houses and how they sometimes flaunted
a title for the purpose, whereupon the well-informed
Mrs. Conrad Jones cited the case of an adventurous
lady from a hat shop who was able to steal diamonds
by passing herself off as the daughter of a peer and
thereby earned seven years penal servitude.</p>

<p>Icy fingers ran along the spine of the Deputy. Here
was the writing on the wall. The half exultant tones
of Mrs. Spencer-Jobling and Mrs. Conrad Jones
seemed to leave no margin of hope. Surely they must
know everything! The coffee cup began to shake in
Girlie’s hand. Even the tall footman eyed her disdainfully.
Only a remarkable effort of the will saved
her from dropping the milk jug.</p>

<p>After a terrible twenty minutes, in which however
nothing happened, the men came in, and as usual they
brought with them an immediate change of atmosphere.
Their geniality again banished for the time being
the awful specter that stalked ever in the background
of Girlie’s mind. She laughed hysterically as Mr. Jupp
cakewalked to the piano and proceeded, by request, to
give his famous imitation of a hen laying an egg with
musical accompaniment. He then rolled back his cuffs
and struck a series of dominant chords. “Now, ladies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>and gemmen.” It was an exact imitation of “Pony”
Moore, the prince of Christy minstrels. “Set to partners,
please. Now, my lord&mdash;her ladyship is ready for
you. And I’ve asked the butler to have a curtain
drawn across the alcove in the hall, so you may treat
it as a private box.”</p>

<p>Shrieks of approval greeted this sally. Girlie’s mingled
with them, although she was ready to sink through
the floor. She dare not look in the direction of Lord
Duckingfield, but that robust gentleman was made of
sterner stuff. There was a light in his eye which informed
Mr. Montagu Jupp that any other man in
England would have incurred a punch on the nose.
Montagu, however, a licensed jester who turned the
most sacred things to mirth and ribaldry with none
to gainsay him, continued to bang the piano, and Lord
Duckingfield with the air of the very good fellow he
undoubtedly was, turned to Lady Elfreda, bowed and
gallantly offered his arm.</p>

<p>The history of the previous evening repeated itself.
If possible, the proceedings were a little more riotous.
Mr. Jupp continued to wave his magic wand and he
had only to do that for mirth and harmony to prevail.
Who could withstand his abounding spirits, his joy in
life, his Gargantuan humor? He was a great natural
force, he filled the bill, the general effect of him was
overwhelming, irresistible.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of discreet maneuvering upon
the hall floor, Girlie’s partner, to her intense dismay,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>steered boldly for the alcove beneath the stairs. There
was no false shame about Lord Duckingfield. Too
many battles had he fought and won to permit a little
crude badinage to turn him from a fixed purpose. He
was in deadly earnest, whether the others guessed it
or not; and in any case they didn’t matter. His mind
was made up. If this little girl would marry him she
would make him a very proud and happy man.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, as he sank into a chair by her side.</p>

<p>How nice he was! That was the thought that passed
through Girlie’s mind as his honest eyes came slowly to
the level of hers. She was in a state of excitement
akin to hysteria, but even at that moment his worth
and his kindness dominated her.</p>

<p>Far as she was in the mire she was not quite lost
even now to a sense of shame. As she felt his eyes
upon her she realized that this was the time to tell him
all. She must not count the cost. He was far too good
to be played with so cruelly. Besides, she owed it to
herself, to her ignoble self, to make what reparation
she could. Let it be made while there was still an opportunity.</p>

<p>For his own part he was baffled by her odd constraint.
There was something on her mind. He could
only guess at what it was. But he was ready to put
his fortune to the proof.</p>

<p>“I am sure I could make you happy.” His hand
touched hers, but she had the wit to keep her eyes from
his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Had she not known before, she knew then that it
was in his power to bring her happiness. And it was
just that fact which seemed to catch her by the heel
as she was about to fling herself over the precipice.</p>

<p>If she did her plain duty and confessed everything,
and heaven knew that she was trying now to school
her tongue to the task, it would be at a terrible cost.
And, face to face with this necessity, she felt she simply
could not pay the price. She would be bound to
lose him. And she liked this man so much that she
could not muster the force of will, at any rate just then,
wantonly to put herself out of court altogether.</p>

<p>Such a failure was illogical, but human weakness
is generally that. She knew perfectly well that whatever
happened this man could never be hers. He was
altogether beyond and above her and her circumstances.
It would make no difference really if he
learned the truth from her lips to-night, or if he
learned it a few days hence by the logic of events.</p>

<p>She saw her duty now a dead sure thing. But she
had not the power of will to do it, not to-night at least.
She heard the odd change in his voice as her silence
began to hurt him; even if she could not actually see
the eyes of anxiety and bewilderment with which he
looked at her, she knew what his feelings were.</p>

<p>For himself he was puzzled, baffled, disconcerted.
He was sure that Lady Elfreda liked him. Her shyness,
her blushes, her charming hesitations told him
that. What was it then that held her back? Why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>could she not give a straightforward answer to a plain
question? There could be but one explanation. It
was one he was loth to accept, yet being the kind of
man he was, he knew how to do so.</p>

<p>“You don’t think I’m good enough.” The pressure
of a decidedly masculine hand tightened upon her fingers.
“Well, my dear, I don’t blame you. I am what
I am.” He sighed heavily. “And you are what you
are. All the same, I think I could have made you
happy.”</p>

<p>Quick tears sprang to Girlie’s eyes. The problem
for her now was not to let him see them. But this,
alas, was beyond her present resources. Her tears
were not to be concealed. Lord Duckingfield permitted
himself a whimsical sigh. She was a little fool. And
at that moment it called for a good deal of self-control
not to tell her so.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the schoolroom at The Laurels that evening, Miss
Cass was condemned to a lonely and unappetizing
meal. Banished in disgrace from the dinner table,
debarred the drawing room and its social joys, “sent to
Coventry” because of her own wickedness, she had
only hard thoughts and the meager fare of war upon
which to subsist.</p>

<p>To-night meat had given out at The Laurels, as it
so often did in the present time of famine, and Miss
Cass had to be content with overboiled codfish and an
insipid sauce, followed by tapioca pudding. Elfreda’s
general dislike of her surroundings had not been made
less when she had found tapioca pudding to be a standing
dish in The Laurels nursery, just as under the
régime of Pikey at Castle Carabbas it had enjoyed
similar preëminence. Moreover, it was of the true
consistency, thick, slabby and odious, in every way a
worthy rival of that which Elfreda and her sisters had
fondly believed to be without a peer in any human
household.</p>

<p>Poetic justice, of course. It served her right. She
was paid out finely. Anyhow, a plateful of this delicacy
gave one a sense of having eaten it, which was more
than could be said for the inadequate portion of codfish;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
and this was something, for Elfreda’s appetite
being extremely healthy, a week of the daily schoolroom
ration had sharpened it to the keenness of a
razor’s edge.</p>

<p>Fortitude was certainly needed for such a situation,
but Elfreda was fully determined “to stick it out.”
Just what was involved in that process would have
been difficult to say. She had no definite scheme in
her mind, but apart from sheer physical discomfort
and boredom, which were by no means to be lightly
faced, she was still enjoying the comedy she had so
audaciously created. Her mood remained highly rebellious.
A second letter from her mother, redirected
by Pikey from Clavering Park, was so full of calm
assumptions, that it merely added fuel to the flame.
But when all was said, it was the position in which she
found herself now that really made the thing worth
while. The fighting blood of her turbulent forbears
had been aroused. She was determined to avenge the
covert insults of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson and of her
niece, Miss Dolores Parbury.</p>

<p>This evening, all the same, low diet and a sense of
loneliness caused her resolution to weaken a bit. The
thing was growing horribly dull. Banishment had
clipped her wings. Isolation had taken a good deal
of spice out of the entertainment. And, to add to a
growing depression, she lacked resources within herself.
She cared little for reading, and even had she
had a taste for it, the books on the schoolroom shelf
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>were not enticing. Nor was she expert with her needle.
Nay, she was frankly bored by the use of it, which
was a pity, since Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had been
at pains to inform Miss Cass that governesses at The
Laurels were expected to help with the children’s
mending.</p>

<p>Elfreda was doing her best to meet these requirements,
but up till now the result had been disaster.
No, she had no claims to be considered a needlewoman,
and as the schoolroom clock struck nine, with a sigh
of irritation she resigned her needle to the work-basket
of the real Miss Cass and sought other fields of conquest.
At the bottom of Miss Cass’s trunk she had
found a new novel in which the future Charlotte Brontë
had rather recklessly invested quite a number of her
shillings. Into this work Elfreda had already made
several spasmodic dips, but by the time a quarter past
nine had chimed from the chimneypiece she had at
last reached the definite and final conclusion that she
preferred “The Swiss Family Robinson.”</p>

<p>Alas, even that classic work, which divided the
honors of the shelf in the angle next the extremely
chilly fireplace with Mrs. Turner’s “Cautionary Tales”
and “Eric, or Little by Little,” failed to excite Elfreda’s
enthusiasm. She fixed a look of ferocious disgust on
the work-basket, that equally unexciting alternative.
What a life the Miss Casses of the world were condemned
to live! She suppressed a shiver and controlled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>a yawn. As soon as the horrid hand of that horrid
clock touched the half hour she would go to bed.</p>

<p>Man disposes! And no doubt the saying applies with
equal truth to woman. For at twenty-seven minutes
past nine there came a discreet knock on the schoolroom
door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Miss Cass, coldly.</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted by General Norris, who
came in rather furtively. He was at pains to close
the door behind him softly and then he said with an
odd hesitation which made Elfreda smile, “I say, Miss
Cass, excuse me, but can you lend me a book?”</p>

<p>Elfreda promptly offered the new novel which had
been ravished from the tin trunk.</p>

<p>“Thanks so much,” said the young man. As a proof
of his gratitude, he seated himself on the schoolroom
table. He produced a cigarette case tentatively. “I
suppose there’ll be an awful row if I smoke here,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, there will be,” said Elfreda. And then she
added slowly, with the <i>sang froid</i> that was so fascinating
to this young man, “but what does it matter if
there is?”</p>

<p>No, this was not an ordinary girl. George Norris
couldn’t help being thrilled by her. “But, I say, it
might be rather uncomfortable for you&mdash;mightn’t it?”</p>

<p>“More uncomfortable than this?” Elfreda’s smile
embraced the fire in the miserable grate, the schoolroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
linoleum, the red tablecloth stained freely with
ink.</p>

<p>“But it’s your living, you know.” This was a very
practical young fellow. In the next instant, however,
he was blushing for his indiscretion. “I beg your pardon.
Impertinent to say that. One oughtn’t to have
said it. But what I meant was it’s seldom wise to
quarrel with one’s bread and butter.”</p>

<p>“I am quarreling violently with mine,” said Elfreda.</p>

<p>“In real earnest?” George Norris was thrilled again.
“Do you mean that? Not giving up governessing, are
you&mdash;if it’s a fair question?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope I am,” said Elfreda, with a heartfelt
sigh.</p>

<p>“Hooray. That’s capital.” His satisfaction seemed
extraordinarily sincere.</p>

<p>The curiosity of Elfreda was piqued by it. A gleam
from those perilous eyes of hers called upon General
Norris for an explanation.</p>

<p>“You’re so much too good for this sort of thing.”
Involuntarily he took a cigarette from its case, placed
it in his mouth and struck a match on the sole of his
shoe.</p>

<p>“But I am not in the least clever.” She saw the necessity
of putting up some sort of a defense.</p>

<p>“No, you are something much better than clever.
You know the world. You know the things that are
things. And that’s why”&mdash;one of his pleasant hesitations
came upon him&mdash;“Mrs. T.-S.&mdash;she’s my hostess,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>but I can’t help saying it&mdash;and Miss P. have such a
down on you. Rotten, I call it. But I don’t pretend
to understand women.”</p>

<p>He looked at her and she looked at him. Suddenly
he grew embarrassed by a sense of his own imprudence,
but she was not in the least embarrassed. To
hide a too palpable confusion he opened the book she
had given him and his eye caught the name “Ethel H.
Cass” on the fly leaf.</p>

<p>“Your name’s Ethel,” he said irrelevantly. But he
felt bound to say something. “One of my favorite
names.” Trivial, perhaps&mdash;but he was really afraid
of silence just now.</p>

<p>“I am always called Girlie at home.” She spoke with
a spice of deliberate enjoyment. After all, this was
quite a promising little scene in the comedy.</p>

<p>He was not sure that he liked Girlie so much. She
seemed perhaps a shade disappointed that he didn’t,
but those deep and dancing eyes with wonderful flecks
of light in them somehow told him to look out.</p>

<p>“Where is your home&mdash;if I may ask?” He flew off
rather nervously at a tangent.</p>

<p>“I live at Laxton.” The sparkle of her eyes was
almost wicked.</p>

<p>“Laxton,” he said. For an instant he was let down
a bit. Laxton was <i>very</i> suburban London. “Always
lived there?” It was by no means a bad imitation of
serene indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“Always. My father was a solicitor. He died some
years ago.”</p>

<p>“A solicitor.” One of the learned professions&mdash;still
George Norris would have put him down as something
else. Suddenly he laughed, perhaps a shade queerly.
“You’d never guess what <i>my</i> father was.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure I couldn’t.” Not the eyes alone
in the unconscious insolence of their candor, but also
the coolly deliberate words held the very genius of
provocation. He half understood why those unsportsmanlike
women downstairs disliked this Miss Cass so
profoundly.</p>

<p>“I expect you’ve had no end of an education,” he
said with a little sigh.</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p>“I know you have.”</p>

<p>She didn’t think well to undeceive him.</p>

<p>“You know everything.” A very naïf young man.
“Seen no end of the world. I daresay you’ve been
abroad teaching English to the children of foreign
royalties.”</p>

<p>She smiled enigmatically. But even if his shot was
a good one it didn’t explain her. This girl was a mystery.
And no doubt she was “pulling his leg,” just
as she had pulled the leg of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson
the other day at luncheon when she solemnly assured
her that her father was a butler and her mother a
lady’s maid. As he remembered that piece of impertinence
he had a sudden desire to box her adorable ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Although, he did not let his mind dwell very long on
any such form of emotional luxury. “I wish I knew
the ropes as you do.” A cloud came upon a singularly
frank and manly countenance. “You see, I want to go
on with my job, but I’m afraid”&mdash;he sighed heavily&mdash;“I’m
hardly up to it in peace time.”</p>

<p>She asked why, having done so well in the war, he
was not going to be equal to the peace?</p>

<p>“Now the fighting’s over you need other things.
Influence and education and so on.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know anybody who could pull strings?”
A chord of real sympathy fused a voice that had a
knack at such odd, unexpected moments as these of
sounding quite delightful.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;frankly, I don’t. You see, in August, ’14, I
was a clerk in the office of an auctioneer. If my mother
could have had her way I should have been given the
education I stand so much in need of now. But my
father thought it wouldn’t answer. And in the circumstances
and from his own point of view he was right.”</p>

<p>“Surely”&mdash;her slow, deep voice seemed to grow
more delightful than ever&mdash;“when one is the soldier
you are, that sort of thing doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it does.” He dissented sadly. “If one
is not to be sidetracked by peace requirements one
must have every card in the game. You see, there
won’t be enough billets to go round and men of my
sort will be the first to feel the pinch. I may not be
quite up to my job, but somehow”&mdash;he drew long and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>whimsically at his cigarette&mdash;“I hardly see myself going
back to a stool in an auctioneer’s office.”</p>

<p>She didn’t either, but she didn’t tell him so. There
was really no need. He had done so much, and at the
back of the curious diffidence which she did not altogether
like and which was his involuntary tribute to
her strong personality, was the power of will that gets
what its possessor wants. And he interested her enormously.
At the moment she had seen him first she had
felt his attraction. Day by day it had grown. And
now as he sat on the schoolroom table talking with the
intimacy of a schoolboy she began to feel a little overpowered.
He was very simple, very wholesome, very
good to look at, and he had proved himself a particularly
fine soldier.</p>

<p>It must have been her silence which told him more
than she desired he should learn. Certainly her inscrutable
eyes gave no information. For quite abruptly,
apropos of nothing at all, he said, “I wonder
if I might call you Girlie!”</p>

<p>Her odd, sudden laugh sounded a little wild to her
own fastidious ear. The sense of the theater, her
private curse, was really just a little too much for her
just then. Delicious, perfectly delicious situation!</p>

<p>“Mind you”&mdash;his frankness was always skirting the
indelicate&mdash;“it’s not at all the right name for you. In
fact, it’s just about the last name you ought to have
had. I daresay you got it as a baby, but why it should
have stuck to you the dear Lord knows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>He suddenly moved towards her. But the look of
her, the droop of the eyelids, the curved thrust of a
strong chin informed him that this was not the time
for a wise man to risk too much.</p>

<p>With a sigh he took refuge in his cigarette. More
than ever was she an enigma, a mystery. This cool
perfection of manner, this almost uncanny power of
taking care of oneself seemed to give the lie almost
as plainly to the Laxton solicitor’s daughter as it did
to the butler and the lady’s maid. What was a girl of
this sort doing in this galley? He was not altogether
a fool, even if she treated him like one. Her arrogance
was boundless, it simply asked for punishment,
but at this tantalizing moment he realized ruefully that
it called for heavier metal than George Norris to administer
it.</p>

<p>His curiosity was horribly piqued. Confound the
little vixen!&mdash;he began to swing his slippered feet&mdash;what
wouldn’t he give to bring her down from her
pedestal! No girl, at any rate of the wage-earning
class, was entitled to bear herself with this sort of
devilment.</p>

<p>Suddenly he determined to give her a kiss. Never
mind the consequences. He would risk the proving that
he was not a gentleman. As far as that went, had he
not sufficiently attested the fact already? Yes, that was
just the secret of the whole affair. And this impudent
“solicitor’s daughter” stunt was her way of letting him
know it. He began to understand the deadly resentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson and dear Dolores.</p>

<p>If ever a girl did deserve to be taken down a peg!
Still at the very last moment, he learned that it was
not so easy for George Norris to play the cad. He
had a desire to press the very life out of this splendid
little beast. The mere look of her was a challenge and
a defiance, but he was bound to remember that
she was a dependent in the house, very much the
underdog, without a means of defending herself. No,
whatever her deserts, it could hardly be called
cricket....</p>

<p>With a start he grew aware that those curious eyes
were fixed steadily upon his own; they might even be
said to look right through them. He had just time
to catch the faintly perceptible curl of a scornful lip,
when without warning the door behind him opened.
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson came magnificently in, a figure
of avenging fate in black satin and jet embroidery.</p>

<p>George Norris was still seated on the table and Miss
Cass in a low chair of decrepit wicker work, was looking
up at him with a smile of challenge in her eyes.</p>

<p>“So here you are, George.” The overtones of Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson’s voice had more resonance than
beauty. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. We
are going to have a little music.”</p>

<p>“So sorry.” George was not impenitent. “But I
just came out you know to smoke a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you said so.” It was evidently not the remark
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson wanted to make, yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>a gathering frown declared that becoming words refused
to occur to her at the moment. As an alternative,
she turned frigidly to the governess.</p>

<p>“Have you darned the children’s socks, Miss Cass?”
The answer was a cheerful affirmative.</p>

<p>“Then, as coal and electric lights are rationed, perhaps
you will not mind going to bed.”</p>

<p>Miss Cass said, with a smile whose candor seemed
to add to its intensity, that she would not mind at all.</p>

<p>Still as George Norris got off the table he was decidedly
glad that at the last moment he had been able
to curb a natural inclination. Never had he felt so
sorry for any one as he felt at that moment for Miss
Cass. Nor had he ever been so much attracted by any
one. A young man of practical rather than ardent
temperament, he hoped he was not going to make a
fool of himself or to lose his head.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVIII">XXVIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y</span> the powers that obtained in the drawing room
the point was much debated whether Miss Cass
could or could not be allowed to accompany the children
on Tuesday afternoon to the Assembly Rooms.
There was much to be said both “for” and “against.”
Had it been left to Miss Parbury to decide the question
“the againsts” would have had it easily. She disliked
Miss Cass with a concentration that was almost terrible.
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had come to dislike her also
with an almost equal intensity, but in her case natural
feelings were tempered by political considerations.</p>

<p>In the first place Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had taken
six tickets for the performance of “The Lady of Laxton”
and these included one for Miss Cass. It was now
proposed that Colonel Trenchard-Simpson should occupy
a stall in her stead, but it seemed that he had
important business on Tuesday afternoon; besides, as
he said, “he was blowed if he fancied sitting up
amongst half the old Tabbies in the county.”</p>

<p>This strengthened the hand of the “fors” considerably,
but in the end that which really gained the day
for Miss Cass may have been her boasted acquaintance
with the Lancelots and above all, her singular intimacy
with the star artiste, Lady Elfreda Catkin. General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>Norris also may indirectly have brought a certain
amount of pressure to bear, because right up till Tuesday
at breakfast when it was announced that the “fors”
definitely had it, he was uncertain whether his leg,
which for several days past had been “throbbing,”
would allow him to attend the performance of the
“Lady of Laxton.”</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, as soon as the decision went
finally in favor of Miss Cass “the throbbing” grew
much less and General Norris felt he would be able to
undertake the journey into Clavering.</p>

<p>As far as it went, all this was very well, but when
the gracious decision was communicated to Miss Cass,
that perverse lady felt she would have much preferred
to stay at home. Happily she did not say so to Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson, but as she considered the problem
over an irritating and inadequate early luncheon in
the schoolroom, with Miss Joan one side of her and
Master Peter the other, she came within an ace of
flatly refusing to go.</p>

<p>Her charges were not entirely responsible for Miss
Cass’s frame of mind. It is true that ten days of
intimacy with their ways had caused their governess
to dislike them more cordially than she had ever
thought it possible to dislike any human beings, but
there were other reasons. The choicest scene in the
comedy was at hand, but she was by no means sure
that she had not lost her taste for it now.</p>

<p>A régime of underfeeding and solitude may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>shaken her nerve a little. Her appetite for adventure
may have lost something of its edge. Still, such an
opportunity to see yourself as others see you was an
all-potent lure, and even if she was going to be revolted
by the spectacle, as most likely would prove to
be the case, it would at least help to relieve a tedium
that was becoming intolerable. Besides she was not
one to funk the last fence even at the end of a most
punishing day.</p>

<p>As the day was fine and there was only a limited
amount of accommodation in the family chariot, Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson decreed that the children should
walk with their governess to the Assembly Rooms. The
distance was rather more than a mile, and in the course
of the journey Elfreda was able to indulge in a little
constructive thinking.</p>

<p>She could not forget that she was now faced with
the footing of the bill. In the course of the next day
or so it would have to be met. She had made a definite
promise to Miss Cass to declare the true state of affairs
and shoulder the entire responsibility. There would
be the devil to pay all round. Her father would be
furious, her mother would never forgive her, but having
the natural temperament of a fighter she was not
afraid of either. Besides, she consoled herself with
the thought that it served them right. It might teach
them not to be quite so cynical in arranging other people’s
lives.</p>

<p>There was a place, however, where she now perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
the shoe was going to pinch. She had just discovered
that she was in love with General Norris.
Had she been quite honest with herself she would have
made that discovery on the very evening of her arrival.
Looking back across the expanse of fantastic difficulties
in which she had landed herself, she saw that it was
General Norris who had supplied the motive power
from day to day. Without the charm of that most
alluring personality she would never have been able
“to stick it.” Life as they lived it at The Laurels
would have defeated her after one irksome and humiliating
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>A hardened sinner, she was wholly unrepentant.
Quite a number of undesirable people had been gorgeously
“scored off.” It was not a case for regrets
on their account, but as, flanked by Miss Joan and
Master Peter on either hand, she trudged resolutely
into Clavering to witness the climax of her audacity
at the Assembly Rooms and proceeded to draw up a
kind of moral balance sheet as she did so, she realized
pretty clearly that there was one item in it that must
throw a considerable strain on her resources. She was
in love with George Norris. And, still worse, he was
in love with her.</p>

<p>Readers of Thackeray will not need to be told that
the Clavering Assembly Rooms are in the High Street,
which is the second turn on the left when you have
crossed the charming little bridge over the River Morwen.
On arrival Miss Cass and her charges found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>they had a few minutes to spare, as the performance
was not announced to begin until half-past two. All
the same the press of carriages in the High Street was
considerable. In fact, it might almost be said to
amount to congestion.</p>

<p>The performance for the first time on any stage of
“The Lady of Laxton,” by Sir Toby Philpot, Bart.,
was under such distinguished auspices that it was recognized
locally as quite a function. For a full quarter
of an hour before the curtain went up the weirdest of
vehicles with the weirdest of occupants&mdash;how they
would have delighted the heart of Michael Angelo Titmarsh,
Esquire!&mdash;streamed incessantly into the High
Street. They were so many, so various, so infrequently
seen that even Mr. Shuker, the dealer in antiques
whose shop was next door to the Assembly Rooms,
who was the recognized local authority on “The County,”
was almost if not quite defeated by such an array.
Had it been humanly possible for The County to baffle
Mr. Shuker, on this historical occasion Mr. Shuker
would have been baffled undoubtedly.</p>

<p>For instance, that closed one-horse brougham whose
lozenged panel displayed a couchant lion and a rampant
unicorn with the simple but appropriate motto
Festina Lente was&mdash;well, never mind who. There
really isn’t time just now to go fully into the matter.
The Armistice is hardly more than a fortnight old,
you know. But you may take it, my dear Titmarsh,
our friend Mr. Shuker could have told you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>Elfreda, holding her charges by the hand, passed
resolutely up the three steps into the vestibule and
mingled with the throng. And what a throng! She
seemed to have known these funny people all her life.
Surely that old thing in the Victorian bonnet was bowing
to her. Could it be old Lady S.? An antique voice
level with her right ear was saying with its curious
drawl, “My brother Alec was at Eton with her father.”
Into her left ear a voice very similar was saying, “The
dear Duke, I suppose, would be her grandfather.” And
at the back a third voice remarked, “The youngest of
six, I believe, but they have all married well. A very
gifted family.”</p>

<p>It was a relief to Elfreda’s feelings when she got
through the crowd into the hall itself. The platform
embellished with footlights and a drop curtain had been
transformed into a stage. So great was the flux of
grandees from miles around that the party from The
Laurels had been relegated to the back row of the
stalls. Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson saw in this circumstance
one more subtle affront to her social position;
all the same the family chariot had arrived a clear five
minutes before Miss Cass, Master Peter and Miss Joan
because, as Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson shrewdly observed
to Miss Parbury and General Norris, “the
people were likely to be more amusing than the performance.”</p>

<p>In a sense, this prophecy was strikingly borne out.
The performance, at any rate in its early phases, promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">very little in the way of amusement. The play</span><br />
itself was almost unbelievably infantile, but this would
not have mattered had not the acting been at the same
level. Hardly had the curtain been up five minutes
before it was clear that the patience of the audience
was going to be sorely tried.</p>

<p>By that time, it was fully realized “behind” that they
were “for it.” The brief opening scene between a
couple of comic servants, although calling for liberal
prompts from the indefatigable Mr. Jupp, really passed
off very well; but its defect was, as the candid critic of
the <i>Dramatic Pictorial</i> was not slow to inform the
author, it didn’t last long enough. The action of the
play really began with the entrance of Sir Toby himself
and with it began the trouble. The little baronet,
of course, had cast himself for the part of the hero;
it was only human that he should do so, but nature
having endowed him with very few inches, a voice so
loud as to verge upon the uncanny and an aggressiveness
of manner which a certain amount of stage nervousness
served rather cruelly to accentuate, those
skilled in the signs began to fear the worst, even before
the worst had happened.</p>

<p>When the time came for the entrance of Lady Elfreda
it was painfully realized, not by her fellow players
merely, but by their friends in front, that upon
her frail shoulders the whole weight of the play would
rest. Unfortunately the house was not composed exclusively
of the polite public of the stalls; a less polite,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>a more general public was herded in other parts of the
building. There was a liberal sprinkling of outspoken
warriors in khaki and hospital blue. From the beginning
they had been inclined “to guy” Sir Toby.</p>

<p>It was a terribly anxious moment when the heroine
came on. All felt her entrance to be the crux of the
play. According to the dramatist’s instructions she had
to greet Lord Longacre rapturously as an old and dear
friend. But even Mr. Montagu Jupp had doubts as
to whether the leading lady would be able to achieve
rapture. Had that man of infinite wisdom but known
it, the problem for poor Girlie was whether the leading
lady would be able to come on at all.</p>

<p>By the time an expert, who had come from London
for the purpose, had duly painted her face and penciled
her eyebrows and the call boy had announced
that the curtain was up, she had to muster the courage
to enter the wings and await her “cue.” She never
knew how she was able to accomplish this. In point
of fact she was in such a state of nerves that it was
only the personal intervention of Mr. Jupp which
saved her from coming upon the scene a full two
minutes too soon.</p>

<p>When at last she did come on, partly by her own
volition and partly propelled by Mr. Jupp, she was
received with a special round of applause. It was thoroughly
well meant, because everyone in the house understood
how much depended upon her, and there is
nothing like encouragement. But, alas, as far as Girlie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>was concerned, the effect of that round of applause
was paralyzing. Somehow it seemed to complete the
grisly process of her undoing.</p>

<p>Standing stock still and looking ready to faint, not
a word crossed her lips. Sir Toby, however, in response
to instructions, whispered sternly from the
wings, crossed the stage heroically and grasped her by
the hand. Another long moment of petrified silence
followed and then he led her to a chair. Girlie, hardly
conscious that the eyes of a bewildered and resentful
audience were fixed upon her, sank down overcome by
guilt, terror and exhaustion.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o</span> draw a veil over the first act of the “Lady of
Laxton” is the part of mercy. Speaking out of
a long and therefore chequered theatrical experience,
Messrs. Garden and Montagu Jupp quite agreed with
one another that it was absolutely unique. They had
never witnessed anything like it. From first to last
not a word of Lady Elfreda’s performance was audible,
a fact which threw into uncanny relief Sir Toby Philpot’s
robust interpretation of the <i>beau rôle</i>. The best
friend of the worst enemy of the little man had
never accused him of being inaudible on any occasion.
And now feeling the entire fortunes of the play
rested wholly upon himself, he gave rein to his amazing
vocal powers. Thus the joint efforts of the hero
and the heroine achieved a result never likely to be
forgotten by those who were present.</p>

<p>At first the audience did its best to bear up. The
polite public in the stalls sat silent and motionless, but
it soon became clear that the less polite public in other
parts of the house was not going to behave with equal
fortitude. Ominous coughs began to arise. A wag
in hospital blue at the back requested Cuthbert to give
the girl a chance. Catcalls followed. Then came boos,
cheers and counter cheers. Finally the curtain descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
with a remarkable abruptness which, however,
was a real relief to everybody.</p>

<p>Girlie returned to the improvised green room in a
state of collapse. Suddenly her overdriven nerves gave
way. To the consternation of the other members of
the cast, whose cup was already full, she uttered a kind
of howl and broke into hysterical weeping. No one
had power to pacify her. For once even the art and
the tact of Mr. Montagu Jupp were at fault. Pikey,
grim and reluctant, was summoned from the audience,
but the appearance of the maid upon the scene seemed
to increase, if anything, the leading lady’s distress.</p>

<p>It was clear, of course, that the play was at an end.
At least, it was clear to all except the author of the
piece. Even now, in spite of all that had happened,
the valiant Sir Toby declined to admit defeat. He
boldly proposed to carry on. In the second act Lady
Elfreda’s part could be read by Mrs. Minever.</p>

<p>“Be sugared to that, my boy,” said Mr. Montagu
Jupp.</p>

<p>Even now, in spite of a series of suppressed sobs
from the green room sofa, the still undefeated Sir Toby
showed signs of a fight. But the firmness of Montagu’s
veto verged upon brutal candor. “They’ll never stand
another act of you, my son,” said the great man in a
Napoleonic aside.</p>

<p>“Let alone of your so-called play,” said the equally
candid Garden. “Don’t you recognize ‘the bird’ when
you hear it, you little ass?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“’Twas Lady Elfreda let the whole thing down,”
the little man persisted.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a matter of opinion, my boy,” said the
genial Montagu. “But I think myself, if we are going
to carry on, that piano yonder had better be moved on
to the stage and if they’ll stand for it I’ll give them a
few selections from my refined musical entertainment.”</p>

<p>“The very thing, Juppy.” Garden laughed and then
he winked at various members of the company. But
it was seen at once that the great man, inimitable in
resource, had found a possible way out.</p>

<p>All the same, there was one exception to the general
chorus of approval. The author of the “Lady of
Laxton” lifted up his voice in a loud wail of protest.
“But the second act is mag-nif-i-cent, simply mag-nif-i-cent.”</p>

<p>“Even if it’s as good as ‘The Importance of Being
Earnest’ it will not be played, my son,” said Garden
with grim finality. “Not on this occasion.”</p>

<p>While the yellow chrysanthemum lady did her best
to calm Lady Elfreda’s shattered nerves, the grand
piano was trundled forth into the middle of the proscenium,
the curtain went up, and notwithstanding incipient
boos and catcalls from the obscurer parts of the
house, Mr. Jupp announced that owing to the sudden
indisposition of Lady Elfreda Catkin, the remainder
of the program would take the form of a refined
musical entertainment. Thereupon the great man,
beaming with good humor, sat down at the piano,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>struck a chord, slewed round on the piano stool to face
the already much relieved audience, and said, “Ladies
and gemmen, the first item on the program is that
old but touching ballad, ‘Down Went Maginty to the
Bottom of the Sea.’”</p>

<p>Corney Grain himself could hardly have bettered
Montagu’s performance. The effect was magical, not
merely upon the turbulent spirits at the back of the
hall, but also upon the more patient sufferers in the
more expensive seats. Not only did Montagu render
the ditty in an inimitable manner, but he also induced
the warriors in khaki and hospital blue to join in the
chorus.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact very little in the way of inducement
was needed. The lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I feel sure he must be wet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For they haven’t found him yet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">were given with enormous gusto.</p>

<p>The change which came over the audience was quite
remarkable. In the reaction from the boredom of
the first act of Sir Toby’s comedy, “the house”
began to bubble with enthusiasm. The broad human
appeal of Mr. Jupp was irresistible. “Down Went Maginty”
was so rapturously received that he had no
compunction about following with “Oh, Dem Golden
Slippers,” which went equally well and “I Fear No
Foe in Swan Pyjamas.” In fact, “the old Pony Moore
touch” was simply invaluable. Even the stern old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>dowagers whose brothers “had been at Eton with the
dear Duke” were enchanted. For a full three-quarters
of an hour Mr. Jupp was kept hard at it with songs
and patter, jokes and conjuring tricks. No man could
have worked more heroically in the cause of charity.
The situation was saved.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXX">XXX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile</span> Mr. Jupp so nobly held the breach, a
doctor was summoned from the audience to
attend Lady Elfreda. On his advice she was sent home
at once to bed in the care of her maid. She was so
overwrought that the doctor, fearing serious consequences,
followed her to Clavering Park, stopping on
the way at a chemist’s in the town to procure a bromide.</p>

<p>Lord Duckingfield, a much embarrassed witness of
the play’s fiasco, had already come to the conclusion
even before the ignominious descent of the curtain at
the end of Act I, that Lady Elfreda had been driven
too hard by the strain of perpetual rehearsal and that
she had been induced to undertake a rôle beyond her
powers. He had now an anxious consultation with
Mrs. Minever as to what ought to be done. Both were
so genuinely concerned that it was decided to telegraph
to Lady Elfreda’s father and ask him to come at once
to Clavering Park.</p>

<p>He was usually to be found in London at the Old
Buck House Club. There a telegram was sent after a
judicious formula had been decided upon so as not to
alarm the paternal feelings of Lord Carabbas unduly.</p>

<p>The yellow chrysanthemum lady, who was really the
soul of kindness, did not wait for the end of the performance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
but accompanied by Lord Duckingfield she
took a taxi as far as the post-office and personally dispatched
the fateful telegram. Then, deeply anxious
for Lady Elfreda’s welfare, they went on together to
Clavering Park.</p>

<p>By the time Mrs. Minever reached home, Girlie,
much soothed by the ministrations of the doctor, had
been put to bed. Here, in as much comfort as a bad
and thoroughly alarmed conscience would permit, she
was found with the grim and scandalized Pikey sitting
by her side.</p>

<p>“How are you, my dear?” said the hostess, kindly.</p>

<p>The invalid, although still looking very white and
strained, said feebly that she was feeling much better.</p>

<p>“I am so glad.” Mrs. Minever took the hand of the
sufferer gently within her own. “The whole thing has
been a little too much for you, I’m afraid. You must
keep very quiet for a day or two, and the doctor says
you must not think of going to Mrs. Lancelot’s, at
least not until the end of the week.”</p>

<p>Girlie’s deep sigh expressed acute relief. With a
feeling that was almost content she closed her eyes. In
the next moment, however, she had opened them again
in horror.</p>

<p>“The doctor says you must stay in bed&mdash;at any rate
until your father comes.”</p>

<p>“My father!” Girlie’s gasp had a thrill in it.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear.” The voice of Mrs. Minever was
very gentle. “Lord Duckingfield and I have just telegraphed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
to Lord Carabbas. We have told him not to
be alarmed, but we have begged him to come down
here to-night, if he can, or by the first train to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It was as much as ever Girlie could do to repress a
groan. But this fortitude was beyond the panic-stricken
Pikey, who was following closely every word of the
conversation. She walked to the window in a state of
terror. At that moment she hardly knew how to keep
from throwing herself out of it.</p>

<p>The hostess strictly enjoined the patient to get some
sound and refreshing sleep and not to worry about
anything, and then she left the room. As the kind
lady withdrew she little guessed the scene of desolation
upon which she softly closed the door. The Deputy
and the duenna were left frozen with horror. They
looked at one another in tragic dismay.</p>

<p>In the end it was left to the unfortunate Pikey to
break the silence.</p>

<p>“Himself!” she gasped. Putting her hands before
her eyes she began to shake miserably.</p>

<p>It needed only this show of impotence to re-awaken
Girlie’s latent hysteria. Tears began to flow down her
white cheeks once again. A longing to kill her came
upon the Werewolf.</p>

<p>In a little while, however, Girlie grew calmer. She
was able to make a supreme effort for self-control.
And, caught in the toils if ever human creature was,
she was even nerved to a little constructive thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“L-Lady Elfreda m-must know at once.”</p>

<p>Pikey remained mute and rigid as a stone.</p>

<p>“You m-must go to her and tell her that her f-father
is c-coming.”</p>

<p>Far from Pikey’s intention though it might be to
accept dictation from Miss No-Class she could yet
judge that the proposal was not lacking in practical
wisdom. Still she did not relish turning out on a winter’s
evening on such an errand. But desperate diseases
call for desperate remedies. After all, it was the only
thing to be done. Elfreda was the key of the situation.
And the sooner Elfreda understood what the situation
now was the better for all concerned.</p>

<p>Finally, and with great reluctance, Pikey consented
to set out for The Laurels immediately. She was
really persuaded to do so less by the forlorn entreaties
of the Deputy than by the hard logic of events. Weakly
and foolishly false to her trust, Pikey felt that she
had perhaps stronger reason than any one else to fear
the coming of Himself.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXI">XXXI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring</span> the remainder of that terrible day Girlie
stayed in bed. And to count the tardy minutes
against Pikey’s return was her only occupation. Alas,
it began to seem presently that the duenna would never
come back. Hour after hour passed. Girlie’s heart
sank to zero. Visions of ignominious disaster rose
before her eyes. Lying there, passing in review all
that had happened in the last incredible ten days it
was impossible to recognize in such a queer adventuress
the rather prim and certainly retiring person she had
always known herself to be. Some strange virus had
infected her. Force of example in the first place, no
doubt, but allied also to a vaulting ambition which had
o’erleaped itself.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock struck. Would Pikey never come back?
Soon, however, the hostess came to see if her guest
was quite comfortable, and to bid her good-night. The
kind lady was full of solicitude. She felt sure that
Lady Elfreda was a delicate flower and that the heavy
task laid upon her had proved too much for her
strength. The doctor had prescribed a sleeping draught
which, in the absence of the maid, Mrs. Minever herself
administered. The patient was then assured that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>doctor would pay her a visit the next morning, and
then the yellow chrysanthemum lady gave the sufferer
a kiss and left her to a much needed night’s repose.</p>

<p>Despite the draught, however, Girlie had never in
her life felt so little like sleeping. Wide-eyed and miserable,
she tossed on a damp pillow, awaiting the
arrival of the one person who could help her now.
Surely Elfreda must come to the rescue. And she
must come to-night. There was no time to lose. For
it seemed to the guilty sufferer that it was of the last
importance that Mrs. Minever and her guests should
be prepared for the truth before the truth was rudely
revealed by Lord Carabbas.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten Pikey returned. But she returned
alone. Very tired and sorely disgruntled she had only
cold comfort to offer. Her reception, to say the least,
had been ungracious. And Elfreda had merely laughed
when she was told that her father had been sent for,
but her message to Miss Cass was that she would come
to Clavering Park in the course of the next day and
clear things up. In the meantime, in the cool and
cynical words of Elfreda, the best thing for Miss Cass
was to stop in bed.</p>

<p>Even this simple alternative proved to be a counsel
of perfection. Left to her own devices throughout
the darkness of many interminable hours, Girlie’s torments
grew. The sleeping draught could not cope
with her agitated brain. After a while, unable to lie
still, she paced the large room. Why had she done as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>she had done? What madness had urged her? Was
there no way of escape!</p>

<p>Between five and six o’clock, however, of that long
vigil she came to a final resolve. She decided to go
away. Exactly where her very small resources would
take her she did not know, but in her present state of
mind any place in the three kingdoms was to be preferred
to Clavering Park.</p>

<p>Accordingly, fired with resolve, she packed a few
necessities of travel into the most portable case she
could find. She then dressed for a journey and with
a sinking heart examined once again the contents of
her purse. Her means, alas, were but two pounds
seven shillings&mdash;two pounds seven shillings with which
to face a cruelly inhospitable world!</p>

<p>That brutal fact must have given her pause had anything
been capable of doing so now. But so little was
she a reasonable being just then that the sheer hopelessness
of such a flight could not turn her from her
purpose. Before setting out on her travels she sat
down at an escritoire and scribbled a hasty and tremulous
line.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I cannot bear this a moment longer. I am going
away&mdash;I don’t know where. E. H. Cass.”</p></div>

<p>She sealed the note in an envelope duly addressed
“To the Lady Elfreda Catkin.” This done, she adjusted
that lady’s velours hat and fur coat, grasped
her traveling bag and leather-handled umbrella and
crept noiselessly, like the little thief she felt herself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>to be, out of King Edward’s room and down the richly
carpeted central staircase.</p>

<p>By now it was nearly half-past six. At present there
was not a sign of the servants, but the light was already
beginning to show above the famous elms in the park.
Gentle-footed as a cat, Girlie crept like a ghost across
the hall parquet. To do that cost her one pang more.
That particular spot was full of memories. No matter
what experiences the future held she would never
be able to forget the kindly simple man who had wanted
to marry her.</p>

<p>She stole through the shadows of a dim corridor to
the heavily barred front door. It proved a nerve-racking
business to withdraw its chains and bolts, yet
it was not these things which suddenly brought her up
short with an icy gasp of fear.</p>

<p>Without warning of any kind a hand was laid upon
her shoulder. As she half turned a strange face confronted
hers in the semi-darkness of the corridor.</p>

<p>“Early abroad.” Whoever the speaker might be his
appearance was a little strained, a little odd. His
voice, with its queer, rather mocking laugh, seemed
equally so. Something there was in the dark, heavily
mustached, rather Semitic countenance, that sent a
chill through Girlie’s heart.</p>

<p>Powerless to speak, she felt her knees sinking under
her. Instinct, that fatal instinct for the world and its
ways, told her at once who and what this man was.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>His next sinister words were not needed to enlighten
her, although they did so quite unmistakably.</p>

<p>“You had better go back to bed, hadn’t you?” The
voice was soft, but it was soft with menace. “You see,
I’ve been looking out for this. Played it up rather
high, haven’t you&mdash;er&mdash;Miss?&mdash;I haven’t the pleasure
of knowing your name. But we shall know it soon
enough, unless, of course”&mdash;the laugh was not at all
kind&mdash;“you are in a position to prove to the satisfaction
of Lord Carabbas that you are really his daughter.”</p>

<p>Girlie, mute and shaking, realized that the end had
come. She continued to listen sickly to the malicious
and unpleasant voice. “As I say, we don’t know who
you are, we don’t know what your record may be, but
if without putting us to further trouble you will tell
us where Mrs. Minever’s sapphire and diamond ring
is to be found I’ll give you my word that the police
will make it as easy for you as they can.”</p>

<p>Bereft of speech, Girlie could only tremble. She had
to lean against the wall for support. This man was
a detective from Scotland Yard who, at the instance
of Mrs. Minever, had come to Clavering Park to clear
up the matter of the missing jewelry.</p>

<p>“Now be a sensible young woman and go straight
back to your room without making a fuss. And just
see that you stay there until I’ve had a chance to have
a little talk with the lady of the house. If you go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>quietly and behave sensibly I’ll undertake to do what
I can for you.”</p>

<p>There was only one thing for it now, and that was
to take the detective’s advice. This, accordingly, Girlie
did. She returned to her room and sat forlornly by
the window gazing on to the park awaiting further
developments. After a time, in spite of the fur coat,
the chill of a November morning fell upon her. Finding
that her teeth were chattering, she decided to return
to her down-quilted bed.</p>

<p>Here, in this temporary security, she toyed with the
excellent breakfast which in the course of time was
brought to her. And then she exerted her will to the
uttermost in order to deal with events as they arose.</p>

<p>The first event to arise was the coming of Mrs.
Minever. Upon the brisk entrance of that lady into
the room shortly before ten, Girlie looked up from an
uneasy pillow to scan the face of the hostess eagerly
so that she might read her doom. But her doom was
by no means easy to read. The hostess was her usual
bright and cheerful self. She had, moreover, the air
of solicitude of the previous night. Girlie, steeling herself
to bear terrible reproaches, was quite at a loss to
understand what had occurred.</p>

<p>“I do hope you have slept, my dear.” There was
absolutely no hint of the early morning drama of the
hall door. “The doctor will be here soon. In the
meantime, you must stay where you are and keep very
quiet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>Immensely reassured by the tone Girlie decided to
do as she was told. All the same she hardly knew how
to hide her surprise. She had been looking forward to
a very different scene.</p>

<p>In point of fact, Mrs. Minever was taking no
chances. The detective had told his story. He had
presented his theory for what it was worth, and to
Mrs. Minever’s keen indignation he had not scrupled
to throw doubt upon the identity of the chief guest.
Mrs. Minever had pooh-poohed the theory. It really
seemed the most unlikely she had ever heard. Not
only was there the evidence of the guest’s coronetted
luggage and personal belongings, there was the word
of Mr. Montagu Jupp and also the fact that she had
been accepted by the Lancelots. No, Mrs. Minever
was not inclined to take risks of that kind. She was
almost tempted to call the detective a fool for his pains.
His theory was monstrous. The poor child was merely
overwrought.</p>

<p>By this time, besides, there was another factor in
the case. A telegram had been received from Lord
Carabbas. Already that peer was en route by the 8.50
from Paddington, which was due at Clavering St.
Mary’s about midday. His arrival upon the scene
would set every doubt at rest.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mrs. Minever, like the wise woman
she was, gave no countenance to these fantastic suspicions.
Yet had she been at all inclined to do so she
must have observed the look of unmistakable horror
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>that came into the eyes of her guest when she was told
that her father would arrive in a few hours. Mrs.
Minever’s one desire was to reassure the nervous and
excitable creature. And so little perceptive was the
good lady that presently she withdrew from King Edward’s
room strong in the belief that she had done so.</p>

<p>Smitten with an ever-growing fear, Girlie lay shivering
with dread. The coming of Elfreda was the
only hope left to her. Would that intransigeant turn
up at Clavering Park before her father? If she did
not the consequences would be too dire to contemplate.</p>

<p>Hardly had Mrs. Minever left the room when the
luckless Pikey came in. She was half paralyzed by the
news. A look of absolute terror entered the eyes of
the Werewolf. The bill about to be presented for
payment was quite beyond the duenna’s power to meet.
She simply did not know how to face Himself. The
whole situation was altogether too much for her.</p>

<p>As for the Deputy she could only continue to hope
against hope for the arrival of Elfreda.</p>

<p>In a short time the doctor came to see the patient.
He considered her pulse and concluded that she was
much better, but advised her to stay in bed and promised
to come again the next day. Girlie, however, did
not follow this advice. For within an hour of the
doctor’s visit she found lying in bed to be more than
she could bear. Tormented by a restlessness that was
really painful, any change was welcome. Therefore
she dressed once more. And as she did so a sort of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>courage came to her. She realized the plain fact that
whether or no Elfreda chose to appear at Clavering
Park further concealment would soon be out of the
question.</p>

<p>At a moment when there was nobody about Girlie
ventured downstairs as far as the hall. She was now
faced with one of two alternatives. Either she must
make a last attempt to get away before public exposure
overtook her or she must abandon herself to the mercy
of Lord Carabbas. Sitting in her favorite nook by
the good log fire with a shawl draped round her shivering
shoulders she did her best to grapple with a truly
terrible problem. Alas, she soon found that it was
not to be grappled with. Her brain refused to act.
Her will was inert.</p>

<p>The minutes ticked on relentlessly. In the process
of time the hall clock chimed twelve. Girlie in a paralysis
of despair settled her miserable self yet more
deeply into her shawl. It would need every ounce of
will she could muster to sustain the accumulated weight
of humiliation that was about to fall upon her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXII">XXXII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> happened, however, that Girlie Cass was soon to
find herself involved in a middle course. The hall
clock had scarcely ceased to strike when Lord Duckingfield
came in from his morning walk. Almost at
once his eye lit on the small abject figure cowering by
the fire.</p>

<p>“Why, here you are, Lady Elfreda,” he said, cheerily.
“I hope you are feeling better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, much better&mdash;much better, thank you.” The
timid, hesitating voice was very forlorn, but it could
find no other words to speak.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad.” And then the honest Midlander
studied his watch. “Your father should be here in
about half an hour&mdash;if his train is punctual.”</p>

<p>A look of simple terror came into the eyes of the
Deputy, but she was seated too much in the shadow
for Lord Duckingfield to be able to see it. All the
same, that gentleman stood looking at her rather oddly
and then suddenly he sat down in a chair by her side.
“I don’t want to bore you.” The tone was very humble.
“But before your father comes, I should like you,
my dear, if possible, to reconsider your decision.”</p>

<p>Such words, spoken as they were with kindness,
delicacy, self-evident sincerity, had the effect of precipitating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Girlie’s overthrow. She perceived the real
goodness of this man. Wild instinct prompting her,
she suddenly took the bit between her teeth. Before
she quite understood what she was doing she began
to tell him everything.</p>

<p>“Suppose”&mdash;her voice was so faint that it was
scarcely audible&mdash;“suppose I don’t happen to be the
daughter of Lord Carabbas?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by all means,” he said, with boyish glee. “Let
us suppose you are plain Miss Brown. Why not? Rank
doesn’t make a pennyworth of difference as far as I am
concerned. True, I’ve set up a title of my own. But
it’s only for advertising purposes.” The laugh of my
lord was very frank. “It helps me in business you
know. In many ways, I don’t mind telling you I should
be more comfortable without any rank at all.”</p>

<p>In the silence, the rather irksome silence which followed,
this almost too-honest man began to feel, as he
so often did, that “he had put his foot in it as usual.”
That phase, however, was brief. For suddenly he
began to realize that he was listening to the recital of
a story almost inconceivably strange.</p>

<p>Girlie’s confession achieved a certain dignity. Her
amazing account of a weak nature in the toils of a
strong one gathered force and coherence as it went on.
Lord Duckingfield could hardly believe his ears. As
he turned to look at the scared and quivering creature
by his side he became the prey of strong emotions.
The one, however, by which he was dominated was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>anger. The little fraud, how dare she! How dare any
slip of a girl play such a trick! For a moment a
primitive savagery filled his heart. Yet being a man
who prided himself on his sense of humor, after the
first shock he was able to laugh.</p>

<p>His mirth was not very spontaneous, nevertheless.
It sounded hollow. He would be a public laughing
stock. But to do Lord Duckingfield justice, he saw
at once that this aspect of the case was not the one
that was going to hurt most. Rooted somewhere in
his robust nature was a genuine regard for this inconceivably
weak and foolish child. She was extremely
pretty, her helplessness was pathetic, she appealed to
the highly developed protective instinct of a strong-willed
male of five and forty.</p>

<p>It was the most genuinely comic story he had ever
heard. And it was entirely amazing. He did not
doubt that every word was true. But for all his balance
of mind and his largeness of view he could not
escape a sense of chagrin. She had led him on to make
a fool of himself. Apart from the question of her
chicanery, which he shrewdly saw went no deeper than
sheer folly, it was going to be very hard to forgive her.
His personal dignity was shattered. True, there was
nothing, absolutely nothing in the whole affair with
which he need reproach himself, but for many a long
year the little world in which he moved would tell the
story against him.</p>

<p>No, he couldn’t help feeling angry. Yet, as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>looked at this little fool, as he looked into those gray
eyes now filmed with tears that from the first had appealed
to him so oddly, he clearly perceived that she
was not the culprit-in-chief. There was sterner stuff,
a force far more potent behind it all. The real Lady
Elfreda, whoever she was, whoever she might be, was
the prime mover in what had happened. At her door
must be laid the guilt of this mad escapade. Common
justice required that on her shoulders the whip must
fall.</p>

<p>Still this absurd, this charmingly pretty Miss Cass
ought not to be let off lightly. But the story she told
revealed the naked truth. And somehow the naked
truth, unflattering as it was to her and to himself,
brought no dishonor. She had been incredibly weak,
she had been morbidly vain, for out of the depths she
had confessed that the <i>Saturday Sentinel</i> said she had
“insight” and therefore she had been tempted to seize
the providential chance of becoming a Miss Cholmondeley
or a Mrs. Humphry Ward; therefore, in the circumstances
of the case, it was impossible for a man
cursed with a sense of humor to lay a heavy hand upon
her. She didn’t deserve to be let off lightly, yet he
didn’t feel inclined even now to hurt her very much.</p>

<p>One question there was, however, that he was impelled
to put to her. And on the answer to it a great
deal must depend. Why had she not told him sooner?
Why had she encouraged him to make such a fool of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>himself? He felt obliged to ask this. And, towering
over her, an avenging figure, he asked it sternly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see what a hole you’ve landed me in?”
he said. “Don’t you think you might have had the
decency to stop me a bit sooner?”</p>

<p>Tears came into the scared eyes. But it was the
tone of the words rather than the words themselves
that drew them.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me before?” The sight of her
tears seemed to make him a shade less magisterial. In
spite of himself he couldn’t help softening a little. And
in Miss Cass’s present state of emotion the merest hint
of softness was too much for her.</p>

<p>“I d-daren’t,” she sobbed. “I s-simply daren’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” It was half indignation, half overmastering
curiosity.</p>

<p>“I l-like you so much I c-couldn’t bear to give you
up.” The truth came out in a gulp.</p>

<p>Once more he laughed. But in the act of doing so
he realized how much this rather rubbishy little thing
had hurt him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIII">XXXIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>efeated</span> by the absurdity of the situation
Lord Duckingfield suddenly ended his interview
with Miss Cass. He still had a desire to chastise her.
But there were certain reservations in his mind in regard
to the little donkey. She had been inconceivably
weak, inconceivably foolish, inconceivably vain; nevertheless
it was the real Lady Elfreda who must be
asked to pay the bill. Even the indignant fancy of
my lord hardly knew how to paint the wanton cynicism
of that young woman.</p>

<p>In the midst of the preposterous scene with the
incredible Miss Cass the angry gentleman felt a craving
for fresh air. He warded off that lady’s threat of
hysteria by turning his back upon her and striding to
the hall door. Let him banish her from his mind&mdash;at
any rate until he had been able to think over the
matter in all its bearings and he had made some attempt
to adjust his mental processes to a quite unparalleled
affair.</p>

<p>However, as he learned all too soon, even that modest
program was not going to be easy to fulfill. For as
he came to the hall door he found himself in the midst
of flurry and commotion. The Park omnibus was in
the act of arrival from the station. With pomp and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>circumstance it had just drawn up to the threshold and
was solemnly disgorging a really imposing vision on
to the front steps.</p>

<p>The honest Duckingfield, confronted by a purple
visage with a monocle glowing in the middle, an overcoat
trimmed with astrachan and a superb expanse of
buff gaiter, had to take a very tight hold upon himself.
The worthy Midlander was not in any way a brilliant
fellow, but five and forty years of traffic with the
world had imbued him with a keen sense of the human
comedy. This somewhat superlative arrival of Lady
Elfreda’s father cast quite a strain upon his resources.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Ducks!” Lord Carabbas offered the large
and genial hand of his race. “Good of you to send
that wire. How’s that unfortunate girl of mine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, better&mdash;she’s much better.” But the eye of
Ducks was a little evasive; anyhow, it sedulously
avoided the eye of the noble marquis.</p>

<p>“Devilish glad to hear it.” Paterfamilias appeared
to be greatly relieved. “I thought from your wire,
that she was in for a bad time. Been overdoing it,
evidently.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, overdoing it&mdash;been overdoing it.” Ducks
again avoided the eye of the anxious parent.</p>

<p>“Great strain, these theatrical performances, hey?”</p>

<p>“No doubt.”</p>

<p>“Hope she hasn’t upset the whole house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;not at all.” Ducks drew on his reserve of
conventional politeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go and have a look at ’Freda. See you
anon.”</p>

<p>Lord Carabbas passed into the house. Lord Duckingfield
passed out of it. Perhaps it was a pity some
imp of mischief did not prompt the worthy Midlander
to stay and witness the progress of his distinguished
friend. Lord Carabbas, a mass of judicious pomp
and fair weather geniality, waddled slowly across the
hall parquet. En route he passed a pretty little girl
shivering by the log fire in the lee of the stairs. The
gallant Irishman, with an unrivaled eye for female
charms, noted her with a smile of approval.</p>

<p>It was a dank morning of November, but for nearly
an hour the man from the Midlands traipsed solemnly
round the park. His mind was in strange disorder;
the oddest things were happening in it, but amid the
flux of thought one phrase slowly crystallized. And
the phrase was significant. “If she belonged to me,”
it ran, “by gad, I think I know what I should like to
do with her.” And the grip of a very honest man
tightened on the stout ash plant in his hand.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIV">XXXIV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile</span> events at the Hall were moving so swiftly
to a final crisis, at The Laurels also there
had been developments.</p>

<p>Having witnessed the fiasco of the Assembly Rooms,
Elfreda had now to face the fact that the game was
up. So far as it went the game had been quite amusing,
but&mdash;and the “but” was decidedly a big one&mdash;it
was by no means clear that it was going to prove worth
the candle.</p>

<p>Over a belated tea in the nursery, as Elfreda grimly
reviewed the situation in all its bearings, she was
almost tempted for a moment to deplore her mischievous
folly. But only for a moment. There was nothing
of the weakling about her. Illogically enough, she was
deeply angry with Miss Cass for making such a pitiable
exhibition of herself, yet when she came to think
matters over amid the boredom and discomfort of
thick bread and butter and lukewarm tea and the table
talk of Master Peter and Miss Joan, she was ready to
believe that the ignominious collapse of the play added
a new spice to the adventure. A set of vulgar people
had been properly “scored off” and for the time being
that was all she cared.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, before the evening was out she had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>withstand a threat of “cold feet.” About seven o’clock
the terrified Pikey arrived with the news that Himself
had been telegraphed for in hot haste. The immediate
effect was certainly to diminish Elfreda’s sense
of victory. She was not really afraid of her father,
she was not afraid of any one, but when “The Dadda”
was fully roused he was an awkward customer to
tackle.</p>

<p>There was a rather bad quarter of an hour with
Pikey. It was also a rather ignominious one. The
foolish old thing had got “cold feet” so badly herself
that she vowed, even with tears, that she would never
return to Clavering Park at all. Stern threats were
required to bring her to reason. And it was not until
Elfreda had made a solemn promise to appear in the
course of the next day at Clavering Park that Pikey
could be induced to return that evening. She, at any
rate, had a wholesome fear of “The Dadda.”</p>

<p>Forced not very willingly into a definite promise,
Elfreda had now to carry it out. Her immediate surroundings
were decidedly uncomfortable, but they did
not lack interest. Indeed, they had a romantic interest.
Miss Dolores Parbury had marked down General
Norris for her own, but the passing of each day merely
confirmed the determination of the new governess to
thwart that lady. He was such an engaging young
man that, leaving out the personal equation, it would
go to Elfreda’s heart, nay, it might almost be said to
impinge on her professional pride to abandon such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>charming novice to the wolves. She was quite sure
that as soon as she withdrew from the scene the wolves
would gobble up George Norris.</p>

<p>The following morning, tense prelude to a momentous
day, found Elfreda’s mind divided against itself.
Even if she was not looking forward to a meeting with
“The Dadda” she was unrepentent for the mischief
she had wrought; but now that she was in the presence
of the fact she simply hated the idea of giving up
George Norris. He was really very attractive. And,
taking the problem he presented on the lowest ground
of all, it would be unpleasantly like defeat to allow
him to be carried off by somebody else.</p>

<p>The morning lessons in the schoolroom had always
been irksome. And to-day they soon became intolerable.
The governess with such grave issues weighing
upon her made little or no attempt to give her mind to
the daily routine. Besides she was in the blackest
of moods. This morning she was hating everybody
and everything. Her temper, which had suffered ten
long days unnatural repression, had now a dangerous
edge.</p>

<p>It was the amiable custom of Master Peter and Miss
Joan to begin the day with a quarrel. And it was regarded
as the first duty of the custodian of these spoiled
darlings to calm their ugly little tempers without losing
her own. From the first, as far as Elfreda was concerned,
this had seemed to ask almost too much of
human nature. A creature of curiously strong antipathies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
she disliked Miss Joan and Master Peter so
intensely that the time had now come when she found
it exceedingly difficult to stay in the same room with
them.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Jo-an, you are pulling my hair!”</p>

<p>“Pe-tah, you story&mdash;you wicked story!”</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the daily duet. And it was
part of the price exacted by Nemesis of Miss Cass’s
deputy. The Lady Elfreda Catkins of the planet must
not suppose that for the average nursery governess life
is a bed of roses. No doubt it was in the interests of
human nature as a whole that they should not. All
the same, by the time the duet had been repeated for
the eleventh successive morning, the Deputy-Miss Cass
would have given much to slay Master Peter and Miss
Joan.</p>

<p>The governess made several attempts to ensue peace.
But this morning her task was not easy. She was
feeling, perhaps too keenly, the pressure of events.
No longer perfect mistress of a sure and balanced self,
she allowed her small tyrants to perceive with the uncanny
acuteness that small tyrants have, that just now
the game was in their favor. And they were tempted
to presume on their knowledge. The thoughts of Miss
Cass seemed elsewhere. This morning there was less
sting in her rebuke; on the surface, at all events, her
manner towards them was not quite so uncompromising.</p>

<p>The duet went on. And so forbearing was Miss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>Cass that its most popular passages were repeated.
New embellishments were even added to the original
performance. For instance, when Miss Joan encored
a particularly neat and effective pinch, Master Peter,
disdaining mere words, suddenly got right home with
a well directed hack on Miss Joan’s shin.</p>

<p>Miss Joan responded with a little howl of fury. This
protest having completely failed to attract the notice
of Miss Cass, Miss Joan proceeded to deliver an honestly
resounding box on Master Peter’s ear.</p>

<p>The reply of Master Peter was to fling ink over
Miss Joan’s copy book.</p>

<p>And then things really began to happen. Miss Joan
cast a hasty glance at the governess in order to be quite
sure that private thoughts still engaged the whole of
that lady’s attention, and then she fairly went for
Master Peter. First the kick was returned with interest
and then ink in liberal quantities was daubed
over Master Peter’s face and collar. This last indignity,
however, proved too much for the self-respect of
a Briton. Master Peter’s rejoinder took the form of
a piercing howl.</p>

<p>Now the howl of Master Peter had such a quality
that it drew Miss Cass abruptly from her reverie. Her
private thoughts were of darkness and eclipse, of battle,
murder and sudden death, but the sound of Master
Peter and more particularly the sight of him seemed
quite to harmonize with them. Master Peter proved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>just a little too much for Miss Cass in the present state
of her nerves.</p>

<p>The reckless Miss Joan did not understand that she
had come already to the edge of a sheer precipice.
Therefore she gave Master Peter’s hair one final tweak.
The voice of Master Peter ascended to heaven. In
almost the same instant something snapped in the
brooding soul of Miss Cass. Pent-up forces were unsealed.
The deep resentments of eleven long and
weary days suddenly burst their bonds. Horse, foot
and artillery, the new governess fell upon Miss Joan.</p>

<p>At the moment of onset Miss Joan merely wondered
what had happened. She seemed to realize vaguely
that it was something very unpleasant. As her spectacles
flew off and her mouse-colored locks escaped the
custody of their puce-colored ribbon, she found herself
projected into a new experience. An experience quite
surprisingly new. She couldn’t breathe. Her eyeballs
seemed to rattle against the back of her ears. And her
knees were in continual danger of knocking chips off
her chin.</p>

<p>The new governess was small, she might even be
said to be “petite,” but she was extraordinarily vigorous,
nay she was more than vigorous. She was remarkably
strong. Generations of stern self-discipline
had curbed the natural spirit of a Berserk, which, all
unknown to its possessor, still lurked below the surface.
But eleven days, eleven long embittered days of Miss
Joan and Master Peter, had unchained primeval forces.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>The new governess fell upon that child and shook her.
She fell upon Miss Joan and shook her until it became
a wonder that one breath remained in the small body.
It was far from the act of a “lady,” yet it was almost
inhumanly exhilarating.</p>

<p>This terrific assault was at its height, and Master
Peter, who had decided to join forces against the
common foe, was indulging in shrill screams which
Miss Joan would have been only too ready to second
had she been in a condition to do so, when Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson opened the schoolroom door.</p>

<p>For a moment the fond mother stood mute and
rigid, a tragedy queen.</p>

<p>“Miss Cass!”</p>

<p>The voice of hard horror was no longer flutelike.</p>

<p>“Miss Cass!”</p>

<p>It was clear that Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson expected
the heavens to fall.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXV">XXXV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>peaking</span> figuratively, the heavens fell. The
scene which appalled the mother of these cherished
darlings was more than she could bear. As soon as
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson realized what was taking
place before her eyes it was just as much as ever personal
dignity could achieve to save her from falling
tooth and nail upon the governess.</p>

<p>“Miss Cass, are you mad?”</p>

<p>For a few brief, glad moments Miss Cass may have
been mad. But as the governess released the gasping
Miss Joan and confronted Miss Joan’s mamma she was
perfect mistress of herself once more. All the same,
there was a dangerous spark in the center of each
sapphire blue eye.</p>

<p>“I consider it an outrage, Miss Cass!” The speech
was punctuated with a stamp of fury.</p>

<p>“Little beast!” That may or may not have been the
phrase that fell from under the breath of the scornful
Miss Cass. But as she stood tense as an arrow
returning look for look, it sounded uncommonly like
it. The fingers of Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson fairly
itched to fly at the little vixen; indeed it was almost a
miracle that they did not, but an ever-present sense of
personal dignity was again her salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>As for Miss Cass, she was amazing. The light in
her eyes positively invited the older and the weightier
lady to a rough and tumble. It was that light, no
doubt, which enabled Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson to
realize that the situation was now at the extreme verge
of the permitted for really well-bred people. Certainly,
if the human eye can speak Miss Cass asked
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson “to come on.”</p>

<p>Of course, as a very little reflection showed, it was
quite impossible for Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson to oblige
her. Besides, as soon as the outraged maternal feelings
had steadied themselves a bit, they found a trick
worth two of that.</p>

<p>For a week past, Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson had been
a painful pilgrim in the valley of decision. Should she
or should she not send away the new governess? With
a feeling of “uplift” perilously akin to joy she decided
suddenly to dismiss Miss Cass upon the spot.</p>

<p>It was the only thing to do. But the act itself in its
barbaric simplicity was very stimulating.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to pack up your boxes, Miss Cass.”
In Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson’s anger there was a quality
of suppressed splendor which made it sublime.
Besides, the phrase itself was an unconscious plagiarism
from the previous day’s ill-fated masterpiece at the
Assembly Rooms: in very similar terms had Sir
Toby’s ill-fated heroine received her <i>congé</i>.</p>

<p>But Miss Cass remained unmoved, stoical, cynically
indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“Please have them packed immediately. I will ask
Miss Parbury to look out a train to London for you.”</p>

<p>That excellent afterthought came as a final bolt. The
incensed lady paused dramatically to mark its effect.
Miss Cass did not blench. Unquestionably, such a shaft
must have gone right home, but the little governess
knew how to conceal the wound.</p>

<p>The whole scene was decidedly humiliating, but after
all, it didn’t matter particularly&mdash;at any rate, to the
Lady Elfreda Catkin. What was going to matter was
the triumph of Miss Parbury. A very attractive young
soldier would have to be abandoned to the siren of
Birmingham.</p>

<p>It was just there that the shoe really began to pinch.
A moment’s thought showed Elfreda that in any case
the shoe must have pinched just there. That romance
had already reached its appointed end. Still, it was a
trifle galling to be “sacked” so ignominiously. Miss
Parbury would gloat. Yes, it was rather astute of
Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson to ask that lady to look out
a train!</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Miss Cass”&mdash;in the exhilaration of the
hour Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson became flutelike once
more&mdash;“it will be quite impossible to give you a reference.
And I shall write at once to Canon Carnaby to
say so. I am exceedingly sorry. In regard to your
salary, I shall consult my husband. Here are two
pounds which will take you to your home.” The magisterial
lady produced a brace of reluctant Bradburys.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>“You may or may not be entitled to a full month. As
I say, I must consult my husband.”</p>

<p>There was not the slightest need for Miss Cass to
smile. Such a moment should have been really painful,
at any rate to a properly constituted mind. But Miss
Cass did smile, moreover so scornfully that Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson found it hard to veil her fury.</p>

<p>“Please go at once and pack your boxes, Miss Cass.
There is a train to London about two, I believe. But
Miss Parbury will be able to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t give any one trouble on my account.”
The tone of Miss Cass had the bite of an acid. “I
am reasonably good with a Bradshaw.” The calm effrontery
of the creature was astounding.</p>

<p>“I am sure Miss Parbury will consider it a pleasure.”
A shade below the belt, no doubt, but then
there are no Queensbury Rules for the ladies, God
bless them!</p>

<p>Beneath the entranced gaze of Master Peter and Miss
Joan the hated Miss Cass made a slow and dignified
exit. They were quite surprised that she didn’t even
slam the door. But if looks are a guide she must have
been really sorry for herself that she was so awfully
much of a lady.</p>

<p>“Jo-an darling, run and ask dear Dolores to look
out the London trains. Or stay, I’ll go and ask her
myself. And then I’ll write to Canon Carnaby.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXVI">XXXVI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> news traveled quickly. Dear Dolores received
it almost at once; and received it, moreover, with
a modesty that did credit to her self-respect; but as she
turned her prompt attention to Bradshaw’s Guide she
could hardly refrain from humming “Any Time’s Kissing
Time” and kindred melodies from Chu Chin Chow.
After all, it is neither just nor wise to exact too much
of human nature.</p>

<p>The second person to be informed was General
Norris. That gentleman, who had just returned from
his morning constitutional, was in the act of crossing
the hall when he suddenly found himself involved in a
riot.</p>

<p>Master Peter and Miss Joan burst out of the schoolroom
dancing a sort of fandango.</p>

<p>“She’s got the sack, she’s got the sack!”&mdash;Miss Joan.</p>

<p>“Hooray, Hooray, Hooray!”&mdash;Master Peter.</p>

<p>Explanations were immediately demanded. Explanations
were at once forthcoming.</p>

<p>“You might almost be said to be pleased,” was the
sad comment of George Norris at the end of their thrilling
story. And he was such a very simple young man
that the sound of his voice suggested tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> think?” The idiom of Miss Joan was
a little primitive, no doubt&mdash;she took after her father’s
side, poor dear child! “She a perfect beast, isn’t she,
Pe-tah?”</p>

<p>“A norrible beast,” Petah agreed.</p>

<p>But in the eyes of George Norris there was a look
that seemed to contradict them flatly.</p>

<p>He was such a naïf young man that the lurid story
of the morning’s war, which to be sure lost nothing in
the telling, came as quite a shock. And the shock left
him sore, rueful, angry. He was not at all inclined
to accept the tale in all its nakedness&mdash;things had been
left out, things had been put in&mdash;and as he had known
from the first, these unsportsmanlike women had had
“an awful down” on the little governess.</p>

<p>The crux of the matter was that she was a rather
special kind of governess. Only too evidently she was
used to the best people and the best houses. George
Norris was too good a sportsman himself to be hard
upon Mrs. T.-S. from whom he had received many
kindnesses or upon Miss P. who was by way of being a
dasher, but the trouble with these ladies was that they
were quite unable to forgive Miss Cass her trick of
making them look cheap. A minx, of course, a perfectly
charming minx who spent her time scoring them
off. She had deserved all she had got. But as man is
the being he is in the world of the present, George
Norris would have liked beyond all things just now to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>have knocked the heads of Master Peter and Miss Joan
together.</p>

<p>The young man in his distress, which he had neither
the art nor the tact to conceal, sought Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson.
He found her seated at a writing table in
the morning room. And flanking her, in a low chair by
the fire, was Miss Parbury poring over with an air of
intense absorption, the intricate pages of Bradshaw’s
Guide.</p>

<p>“There’s a train at a quarter-past two, I see,” Miss
Parbury announced as General Norris entered the
room.</p>

<p>“That is the one. She must go by that.” Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson dipped her pen augustly. “Tell
me, what’s the date, dear?”</p>

<p>Miss Parbury had a doubt as to the date, but General
Norris succinctly furnished it from the top of <i>The
Times</i> newspaper which providentially was at hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Dear Canon Carnaby,</p>

<p>It is with the greatest reluctance that I write to tell you
that the governess whom you recommended so highly has
not been a success. In fact, she has proved so altogether
unsatisfactory that I am having to dispense with her services
at a moment’s notice. You will be grieved to learn that I
am unable to give her a reference. In my humble opinion
she is wholly unsuited to the care of young children. Her
temper, to put the case mildly, is under imperfect control
and much as it distresses me to have to say so, she does not
invariably speak the truth; also her manners leave much to
be desired. On several occasions she has been openly and
intentionally disrespectful. I am sorry to have to write in
this way of one who has been able to recommend herself to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>your kindness, but it seems right that you should know the
sort of person she really is.</p>

<p>With kind regards, believe me, very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">M. Eleanor Trenchard-Simpson</span>.</p></div>

<p>She read the letter over with a glow of quiet satisfaction
and then gave it to Miss Parbury for perusal
and criticism. Miss Parbury’s criticism was that she
didn’t think it was strong enough.</p>

<p>Taking it altogether, Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was
inclined to think the letter didn’t lack force.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that.” Miss Parbury fixed one
arctic eye upon the mobile countenance of General
Norris. “Considering that she has just pretty nearly
killed poor Joan.”</p>

<p>“Killed poor Who?” The development of the issue
was growing too much for the feelings of an impressionable
soldier.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear the uproar in the school room,
George?” A shade of maternal reproach softened Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson’s note of indignation.</p>

<p>George confessed that he had not.</p>

<p>“Why, even Cook heard it in the basement. And
when I went into the schoolroom what do you suppose
was happening?”</p>

<p>George had not the faintest idea.</p>

<p>“I found Miss Cass”&mdash;it was the voice of a Niobe
mourning her young&mdash;“shaking the life&mdash;literally shaking
the life out of the poor darling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“Well, the poor darling seems a pretty lively corpse,
I must say.”</p>

<p>It was, of course, a remark that ought not to have
been made. A military career has a tendency to make
the best and the nicest of men unfeeling. There was
that to be said for George Norris. Both ladies, however,
were clearly wounded a little. Their quiet air
of triumph was almost vanquished by such gaucherie.
Men are so amazing! Some men are, at any rate.
How was it possible to defend such a creature! Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson painted a full-length portrait of
the wicked Miss Cass, and as a final touch invited the
young man to read the letter she had just addressed
on the subject to the Rector of Laxton.</p>

<p>The invitation was an error of judgment. And it
really seemed odd that one so conspicuously a member
of the sex which specializes in finesse in all its branches
should have made such a mistake.</p>

<p>George Norris read the letter to Canon Carnaby
with amazement. Nay with more than amazement.
The young man found it hard to conceal his wrath.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXVII">XXXVII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>iss Cass</span> was duly informed that her train was
the two-ten. The family chariot had been ordered
for half-past one, an insurance as far as was
humanly possible against her missing it. Luncheon, in
the meantime, was served to her in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>George Norris was quite upset. Clearly he was expected
to share the righteous indignation of the ladies
of the household, but this was asking too much of
human nature. As for Miss Parbury’s air of triumph,
he found it intolerable.</p>

<p>In truth, this was a dark hour. For the young man
now realized that he was very much in love. The
drama of this abrupt departure brought home the fact
rather unpleasantly. A very little reflection showed
that his hesitations and moral cowardice of the last
few days were going to cost him dear.</p>

<p>On three consecutive mornings had he made up his
mind to propose to Miss Cass before the day was out.
But the end of each day had found him unequal to the
task. He didn’t quite know why. Sheer human weakness,
no doubt, had led him to put off till the morrow.
And it was now too late.</p>

<p>Somehow the little governess had always contrived
to keep him rather at a distance. He had never quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>known the ground on which he stood. She was a most
dexterous fencer, her heart was not worn on her sleeve;
and in spite of his military renown he was not quite
sure of himself. But the “sacking” at a moment’s notice
of this extremely fascinating little lady brought
things at once to a head.</p>

<p>It roused the chivalry in the breast of George Norris
to the danger point. He felt that he must speak now
or forever hold his peace. This was a chance that
could not recur. If he let her go now he was never
likely to meet her again. In a state of high tension
he began to range the house, yet halting always at the
schoolroom door with two sinister words echoing and
reëchoing in his mind. Too late! Too late! was their
diabolic chorus.</p>

<p>Even now he was set upon one last attempt. She
must not go away like that. It was the fifty-ninth minute
of the eleventh hour, he would have to rush his
fences horribly, but no matter he must put all to the
touch.</p>

<p>The schoolroom door confronted him. But in spite
of the row of decorations on his tunic his courage suddenly
failed. One can hardly propose to a girl in the
middle of her luncheon! Some men might be equal to
such a task: a strenuous military life had taught
George Norris that some men are equal to anything,
but even in this impasse he thanked his stars that he was
not of their number. No, confound it all, he must let
her eat her luncheon anyway!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>The grandfather clock in the hall chimed a quarter-past
one. He was cutting it decidedly fine! Again
one of his fatal hesitations came upon him. Only a
fool would think of butting in now. Better far be content
with obtaining her permanent address and sending
through the post an offer in his best English. But
the Dr. Jekyll in his composition&mdash;or was it the Mr.
Hyde?&mdash;assured him that such a bloodless proceeding
was bound to fail. Wiser by far, thought Jekyll-Hyde,
to trust implicitly to the personal equation. Let him
go ahead with the business, luncheon or no luncheon,
then and now!</p>

<p>Yes, after all, that was the sound commonsense of
the matter. The hand of George Norris sought the
knob of the schoolroom, but before he could turn it,
the door of the room opposite came abruptly open.
“George,” said Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson with a glance
at the venerable article of furniture across the hall,
“Tell me, isn’t that clock slow?”</p>

<p>With a stab of keen annoyance George looked at
his watch. Alas, the clock was certainly slow, by a full
ten minutes. And in confirmation of the dire fact a
severe parlor-maid and a giggling subordinate emerged
at that moment round a bend into the visible part of the
staircase in charge of Miss Cass’s rather meager but
heavily burdened tin trunk.</p>

<p>In almost the same instant there came a sharp peal
at the front door bell. It was an intimation that John
Small was round with the family chariot.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXVIII">XXXVIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hatever</span> the disabilities of General Norris
there was not a suspicion of false shame about
his hostess. She took the knob of the schoolroom door
out of the young man’s hand and turned it for him.</p>

<p>“Miss Cass.” The flutelike note rang clear and free.
“No wish to hurry you, Miss Cass, but the carriage
is waiting.”</p>

<p>Miss Cass lifted her eyes calmly from her cheese.</p>

<p>Then she glanced at the watch on her wrist&mdash;an adorably
neat watch on an adorably neat wrist&mdash;quite
leisurely. “Thank you,” she said drily. It was really
the driest “Thank you” George Norris had ever heard.</p>

<p>As she rose from the table with a deliberation which
to Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson was rather infuriating,
that lady observed the hat of the retiring governess. It
was decidedly expensive. And her gloves and shoes
could not possibly have been warranted by her salary.
On the other hand George Norris observed none of
these things. He was occupied far too much with their
wearer. But above all, he was occupied with that sinister
chorus in his brain, “Too late, too late!”</p>

<p>All was lost. And he had but himself to blame. In
a kind of dull rage he stepped up to the open door to
watch the lading of Miss Cass’s luggage on to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>chariot. The mien of John Small was a comedy in itself.
He at least was ready to welcome the departure of
one who had kept him in his place as determinedly as
he attempted to rise above it. As John Small hoisted
the tin trunk on to the back of the dog cart he had the
look of a man well satisfied.</p>

<p>That look was oddly reflected in the bearing of Miss
Dolores Parbury, who at the chosen moment emerged
from the morning room to speed the parting guest.
There was a kind of wary triumph in it, a triumph not
so much open and avowed as tacit and concealed.
After all, Miss Cass was only the governess. But there
the triumph was, at any rate, for the eye of George
Norris, who suddenly found that it was more than he
could bear. As he caught the slightly averted glance
of Miss Cass that was like nothing so much as a sword
half-sheathed, his heart went out to her. In defeat she
was sublime. Faults she might have; her manner with
young children might leave something to be desired,
but <i>au fond</i> she was a fearless warrior and she had been
endowed with so much charm that nature hardly seemed
to be playing fair to the average members of Miss
Cass’s sex in allowing her to treat it as a proprietary
article.</p>

<p>The gallant George did not try to analyze the situation.
He was a man of action, for one thing. Besides,
there really was not time. This was the crisis
of his fate, and events were moving with alarming rapidity.
Before he could regain complete control of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>mind, the inimitable Miss Cass was making her
adieux.</p>

<p>With the faintly mischievous smile which invited intimacy
and yet repelled it, she offered her hand.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” she said.</p>

<p>But George, hypnotized by the touch of her fingers,
felt quite unable to say good-by. He knew that immediately
beyond the little lady two pairs of eyes,
scorpion in their burning intensity, were directed upon
him. He knew that anything he said or did now
would be used in evidence against him, but it was
asking too much of human nature to let her go like
that. He didn’t know her plans, he didn’t even know
her address! A mine had been sprung under his feet
by the forces of injustice; but he would never be able
to forgive himself if he lost her without making a sign.</p>

<p>The forces of injustice were ruthlessly dominating
the scene. But what did it matter? What did anything
matter? This was Fate’s hour. If at such a
moment he failed to show himself a man it would tell
heavily against him in the ultimate assize.</p>

<p>“I’ll come to the station and see you off!” The daring
of the speech was incredible; at least, so it seemed
in the ear of two of the ladies. In the ear of the
lady to whom it was addressed, by one of those piquancies
which make the human comedy the infinitely delightful
thing it is, it was accepted at its face value
with a complacency that was hardly decent.</p>

<p>“How extremely kind of you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>A shiver ran through the stout fibers of Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson. The robust Miss Parbury had
a horrid momentary feeling that some one was in the
act of walking across her grave.</p>

<p>“But, my dear George,”&mdash;the voice of the hostess
was imperious, yet by comparison with the organ tones
around her it sounded oddly high and thin&mdash;“luncheon
is at a quarter to two. Aren’t you forgetting?”</p>

<p>The intrepid young man was not forgetting. He
could easily obtain a sandwich at the station.</p>

<p>“But how absurd!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson waited an instant for the
departing governess to agree that it <i>was</i> absurd, as
any self-respecting governess must surely have done
in the circumstances, but she waited in vain.</p>

<p>“It is not in the least necessary. Small is quite able
to help with Miss Cass’s luggage. Are you not,
Small?”</p>

<p>“Yes, m’m,” came a slow but truculent response
from the seat of Jehu.</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” The young man was amazing. “Much
better let me. Porters are in such short supply at all
the stations these days. Besides, I want to send off a
wire. So that if there’s room at the back of the cart
for me as well as for that trunk&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Woa-a-a horse!”</p>

<p>George, the incredible, had one foot on the back
step already. Miss Cass, smiling and calm, was seated
deftly in front. If the look of her had a meaning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>she knew only too well that all the cards were in her
hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson saw that the game was
going against her heavily, but she gathered herself for
a final throw. “My dear George, you will catch your
death,” she cried.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a dank morning of November. There was
even a thin spatter of rain. George, the overcoatless,
reluctantly lifted his foot from the step of the dogcart.
“I’ll get my British Warm,” he said.</p>

<p>Too elemental for a thought of treachery to enter
his mind, the young man turned suddenly into the
house in quest of that garment.</p>

<p>Openly and palpably fighting for victory Mrs.
Trenchard-Simpson saw her chance. No modest scruple
stayed her. “Drive on, Small,” she said sternly,
as soon as the young man had passed indoors. “Don’t
wait for General Norris.”</p>

<p>Small, ready at all times to obey his mistress, was
prepared to do so now. He may or he may not have
had a full grasp of the case. Such fellows are not
always so wooden-witted as they appear. But he
valued his place and beyond a doubt he would not
have waited for General Norris had it not been for
the prompt intervention of the lady who shared with
him the front seat. With a suddenness very disconcerting
to John, the shameless Miss Cass sprang to her
feet. “My box is not very secure, I’m afraid. It
might fall out at the back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>“Your trunk is quite all right, Miss Cass,” promptly
and energetically countered Mrs. Trenchard-Simpson.
“It cannot possibly fall out. Small, drive on.”</p>

<p>Hardly a minute was occupied by the entire incident.
But the situation was saved. Before John Small had
a chance of getting under way, General Norris, becomingly
clad in his British Warm had emerged from
the house and had again placed his foot on the back
step of the chariot.</p>

<p>“Never mind your box, Miss Cass,” he said cheerily.
“I’ll take care of that.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLIX">XLIX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll</span> the way to Clavering Station George Norris
took extremely good care that the tin trunk of
Miss Cass did not fall from the back of the dogcart.
His task was not difficult, for the box was so comfortably
disposed under the seat that it showed not the
slightest disposition to do so. But had it been a tin
trunk with any spirit of opinions of its own it might
easily have achieved a crash to Mother Earth at the
sharp turn into the high road by The Laurels gate and
at divers trappy places along the route, for there really
was a much preoccupied young man in charge of it.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that it had almost immediately
dawned on George Norris that should the
2:10 Up be punctual it would leave very little time
for a proposal in form. Moreover, it would have to
take place on the station platform. Such are the inconveniences
of a dogcart. In the circumstances of
the case it seemed hardly less than a grave oversight
on the part of Fate to have omitted to provide a closed
brougham, no matter how antiquated, one-horse or
otherwise, for such an occasion.</p>

<p>Certainly it meant cutting the whole thing very
fine. According to the rate of John Small’s progress
they were not likely to reach Clavering station much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>before two o’clock and that left little time for the
business in hand. As a matter of historical fact, it
wanted exactly one minute to the hour when they drew
up beneath the portico of the station yard.</p>

<p>George had to justify his presence by seeking a
porter in the station interior. To do him justice they
undoubtedly <i>were</i> in short supply, but he was able to
corral one in something under two minutes and returned
with him in triumph to find Miss Cass handsomely
tipping John Small for services unwillingly
rendered. In fact, when John withdrew, chariot and
all, he was quite a changed man. From the moment
he had first set eyes on the new governess he had been
her enemy, but if anything was meant by the manner
of his final exit from the station yard she was almost
entitled to look on him now in the light of a friend.</p>

<p>The departure of John left a bare six minutes or so
for the all-important matter to be transacted, always
providing that the train was punctual. Happily the
porter was very reassuring on this point. According
to his estimate the 2:10 Up was bound to be anything
from twenty to forty minutes late. Moreover, if he
was betting on it he would back the second figure
rather than the first. So far, so good.</p>

<p>However, there was a dramatic surprise in store
for George Norris. Indeed, there was a series of surprises.
And they began almost at the moment John.
Small and his chariot left the station yard.</p>

<p>“Please label this,” George directed the attention of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>the porter to the tin trunk. “Waterloo or Paddington?”
he inquired of its owner.</p>

<p>Then came surprise the First.</p>

<p>“I think it had better be put in the cloak room,”
said Miss Cass. “And these, I think, had better go
with it.” She indicated the pilgrim basket and another
miscellaneous article ranged beside it. “I am not going
by this train,” she added quite casually.</p>

<p>The heart of George Norris gave a leap.</p>

<p>“So much the better.” And the young man spoke
with the simplicity which made him so attractive.</p>

<p>With quite a sense of relief he saw the luggage of
Miss Cass stowed away in the cloak room. And then,
like a man of will who has just been confirmed in a
great decision, he addressed that lady. “I don’t know
what your plans are,” he said, “but if I may, I would
like to have a little talk with you.”</p>

<p>The only answer of Miss Cass was a smile. But
she made no difficulties about having a talk with General
Norris. As intending passengers were now
rapidly assembling for the Up train, they crossed the
bridge to the deserted Down platform. No one else
was there. They took one brief turn and then sat
down on a wooden bench thoughtfully provided by the
railway company.</p>

<p>This the hour and this the opportunity. There was
no beating about the bush. George knew his own
mind and proceeded to ensue it. “Ethel,” he said, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
one small gloved hand in his own, “will you
marry me?”</p>

<p>It was by no means an easy fence to tackle, but
George’s methods were decidedly workmanlike.
“There’s only my pay, but I’ve just been offered a
good billet in East Africa. The climate is first rate,
there’s any amount of things to do and one can live
at much less cost than one does here. Of course,
there’s no saying exactly how it will pan out, but anyhow,
will you chance it?”</p>

<p>It took Miss Cass but a very short time to express
her willingness “to chance it.” She too, it seemed,
had the valuable faculty of knowing her own mind.
Not in anywise immodestly did she rush upon her fate;
she was able to display the conventional diffidence of
one fully acquainted with the rules of the game, but
it was not difficult to set the doubts of George Norris
at rest. From the moment he had climbed into the
back of the cart she had known that he was hers.</p>

<p>En route to the station there had been an opportunity
to weigh the pros and the cons of the matter in
her cool and sagacious mind. All the same, it was
not coolness nor was it sagacity that had carried the
day with her. She liked this young man because she
liked him. He was the new, highly efficient type the
war had evolved. She knew nothing about him, but
instinctively she would trust this man as she would
trust few men when it came to a tight place. And
there was an air of romance about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>It was an act of foolhardiness, no doubt, for a girl
of position, but she had been made reckless by recent
events. Besides, she was “out” for freedom. She
had had one brief taste of it, and making due allowance
for its drawbacks, her appetite was keen for more.
Irksome the experiences of the last ten days had certainly
been, yet she was quite determined now to do
as she chose with her own life. She asked nothing
highfalutin’ nor did she look for it, but she meant, if
possible, to escape altogether from the stuffy circle
of Castle Carabbas with its hierarchical connections
and its feudal ideas. Now was the moment for those
autocratic people, her father and mother, to learn once
for all the limit of their power.</p>

<p>As there was no one else on the Down platform, they
were able to seal the compact in the fashion ordained
by nature and custom. “But, do you know,” the
young man confessed even at this delicious moment,
“if you hadn’t been so much up against it I mightn’t
have had the pluck to ask you.”</p>

<p>Such naïveté delighted her. Also, it was very intriguing.</p>

<p>“But why not?” she archly inquired. “I’m only a
friendless governess, am I not, with food and house-room
provided and a wage of thirty pounds a year?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are down on your luck,” he frankly admitted.
“But I don’t mind betting a shilling that you
haven’t been so always. Now tell me honestly, haven’t
you once been Top Dog?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>She didn’t try to conceal her amusement even if
she masked a proper feminine curiosity. “I don’t
know why you should think so,” she said with the
smile provocative which yet was a counterfeit of complete
indifference.</p>

<p>“There’s something about you”&mdash;his naïveté was
charming&mdash;“that is always giving you away. In fact,
it wouldn’t surprise me if this was your first situation.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you say the other day”&mdash;she would have
been less than her sex had she not enjoyed drawing
him out&mdash;“that you thought I had been abroad in the
service of foreign royalties?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had all sorts of theories about you,” he confessed.
“But it won’t surprise me at all if none of
them meets the case.”</p>

<p>She archly expressed relief, the light of humor in
her eye. He was enchanted by the look of her and
yet he was a little anxious too. At the back of his
mind there was a subtle feeling that “he was having
his leg pulled.” The feeling had always been there,
even from the first moment he had talked with her.
Somehow she was immensely mature for her years.
She appeared to have so much in hand. And a word
here and there, an odd phrase, a chance inflection
of voice, even her way of looking at people and her
manner of entering a room were continually giving her
away.</p>

<p>Besides, he had seen from the first that the other
ladies of the household had regarded her as a natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>enemy. Perhaps it was the sense of their injustice
that had first drawn him to her. But from day to
day he had increasingly admired the bold and implacable
skill with which she had carried the war into the
country of her foes. She mightn’t have one shilling
to rub against another, this mysterious little lady, but
she had rare courage, great will power and infinite
resources of her own.</p>

<p>All the same, sitting delightfully close to her on a
seat of the deserted Down platform and the great deed
done, even at this exquisite moment he was not absolutely
sure that she was not laughing at him. And
in spite of the elation within this feeling grew
upon him as they talked. Somehow, he was less
certain of the prize he had won than a victorious suitor
should have been. And he had not to look far for
reasons.</p>

<p>The 2:10 Up was duly signalled, a full twenty
minutes late. Presently it drew up with a prodigious
rattle at the platform opposite.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are going up by the next,” said
George. “But it’s not so good as this one, you
know. It doesn’t start till something past five and it
won’t get there until a good bit past one in the morning.
I know, because I’ve traveled by it for my sins.”</p>

<p>Ethel&mdash;already he had permission to call her Ethel
because somehow Girlie didn’t suit her at all!&mdash;rejoined
that no matter what her sins might be it was
not necessary for her to travel to town by the 5:40.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>“What, you are staying the night here in Clavering!”
His tone was a complex not unpleasing of
hope, fear, surprise, bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Ye-es, in the neighborhood, I think, unless I suddenly
change my plans.”</p>

<p>“With your mother’s friends, the Lancelots, I suppose?”
He couldn’t help laughing as he recalled the
audaciously comic turn she had given to the topic
of the Lancelots at the family luncheon.</p>

<p>“I’m sure they’ll put me up for a night if I ask
them,” she said demurely.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure they will. They’ll be delighted.”
But even now he didn’t really know if he was justified
in taking her friendship with the Lancelots seriously.</p>

<p>She was a mystery, that was the truth of the matter.
And her answer to his next question provided ample
confirmation of the fact.</p>

<p>The question itself was a simple one. What were
her immediate plans? In his rôle of accepted suitor
he felt it incumbent upon him to ask. Had she relations
in the district? If she had, might he accompany
her forthwith and be presented to them.</p>

<p>Her reply was brief but it was surprising. “Oh,
yes, do come with me by all means&mdash;to Clavering
Park.”</p>

<p>“To Clavering Park!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to meet my father.”</p>

<p>To meet her father! The gaze he fixed upon her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>was blankly incredulous. But in the fragment of time
necessary for a survey of her expressive countenance
the fable of the dead solicitor’s daughter collapsed
completely and for ever.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o</span> Clavering Park&mdash;to meet her father!</p>

<p>George had been pretty sure from the first
that she was playing a part. But what was the part
she was playing? Who was her father if he was not
a deceased solicitor? He did not forget her other
picturesque statement that she was the offspring of a
butler and a lady’s maid. George was inclined to think
that so far as he himself was concerned it might simplify
matters considerably if this proved to be the
case. Still, it would not be wise to build hopes
upon it.</p>

<p>The young man began to view a developing situation
with a deepening anxiety. Instinct told him that there
might be rocks ahead. “By the way, who is your
father? What is his name?”</p>

<p>“You must come and meet him.” With a laugh
defiant rather than gay she got up abruptly from the
station bench.</p>

<p>Perforce it had to be left at that, for the time being
at all events. George was prepared to go with her to
the world’s end if she commanded him, so why not to
Clavering Park? He rose, too, from the bench and
went with her across the bridge to the Up platform
just as the belated 2.10 was in the act of moving off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>In the station yard was a decrepit taxi which they
were able to hire and in about half an hour the lodge
gates of Clavering Park confronted them. By now
the bewilderment and curiosity of George were almost
unbearable. He was in the seventh heaven, it was
true, but native commonsense grimly warned him that
his heaven was strangely insecure. The romance of
the circumstances was weaving a spell of its own; the
sense of enchantment increased as the mystery grew;
he was beginning slowly to realize what a truly delightful
thing she was to possess and on that very
account, as became one who had learned much in a
hard school, he understood how necessary it was to
take care. There must be no counting of chickens.
Somehow the nearer they drew to their destination
the less favorable grew the portents. By the time the
lodge gates had opened and their taxi had rattled
through, the sense of “Ethel’s” innate Top-Doggishness
had developed quite remarkably.</p>

<p>“Those trees and the deer remind me of my home.”
She might have been speaking for the sake of conversation;
on the other hand her intention may have
been to prepare his mind for certain revelations to
follow.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Ethel, where is your home?” In his own
apprehensive ear his voice sounded odd, strained,
nervous.</p>

<p>“I live in Ireland.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“I used to live there too,” he said. “Ireland was
where I was brought up.”</p>

<p>“Really. Now that’s very interesting.” The tones
of her voice were so soft and warm and rich that they
made him think of velvet. “Do tell me exactly where.”</p>

<p>“I was brought up at a place called Bally Euchra in
County Kildare.”</p>

<p>She gave a faint cry of suppressed astonishment.
“What a small world! Bally Euchra of all places!
Why, my grandfather lives there.”</p>

<p>Barely had he time to echo her surprise with a faint
cry of his own when the taxi drew up beneath the
portico in front of the house, thereby denying him
the opportunity of asking who her grandfather could
possibly be.</p>

<p>It was just as well, no doubt, that such was the
case, for had that particular question been answered,
there is little doubt that George Norris would have
bolted for his life!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLI">XLI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">G</span>eorge</span> rang the bell. Of the servant who
promptly answered it “Ethel” asked if Lord
Carabbas was there and if so could they see him.
The man said he would inquire and showed them in.</p>

<p>“Lord Carabbas!” Midway between astonishment
and dismay Ethel’s cavalier muttered to himself that
name of ill omen as they entered the house.</p>

<p>The servant politely indicated chairs in the hall and
then went in search of Lord Carabbas.</p>

<p>In the waning light of the November afternoon the
hall seemed to be deserted. But it was not. Deep in
a corner near the large open fireplace was an unsuspected
presence. And scarcely had they time to realize
that a third person was there when the presence sprang
out upon them.</p>

<p>With a cry that was half a sob, half a shriek, Girlie
fell upon Elfreda and flung both arms round her. By
means of the spate of wild words that followed,
Elfreda learned that Girlie was ruined irretrievably,
that her career was blighted and that she fully expected
to be sent to prison.</p>

<p>“Sent to prison! Pray, whatever for!”</p>

<p>With the aid of a second spate of half suppressed
sobs Girlie told the story of the missing necklace; she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>also disclosed that a Scotland Yard detective was going
to arrest her on suspicion.</p>

<p>George Norris, embarrassed considerably by a scene
of which he was rather an unwilling witness and the
cause of which was very obscure, nervously withdrew
some paces into the hall proper. He was greatly
troubled. The plot was thickening. But as to what
had actually occurred he was quite in the dark. Here,
however, was mystery indeed. Moreover, the march
of events still gave no clew as to the ground on which
he stood.</p>

<p>Still, he was at the threshold of enlightenment.</p>

<p>In a short time the servant returned. He was accompanied,
however, not by Lord Carabbas but by the
mistress of the house. Mrs. Minever greeted Elfreda
in a sort of flutter of curiosity. She then went on
rather incoherently to explain that Lord Carabbas was
out. Would the visitors care to wait for him as he
was expected back quite soon? With surprising coolness
Elfreda promptly accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>George for his part could still only view the situation
with bewilderment. He was altogether in the
dark. His bewilderment, moreover, was now tinged
by alarm. For reasons of his own he had no particular
desire at that moment to meet Lord Carabbas.
The stern fact had not yet dawned upon the young man
that Lord Carabbas was the father of “Ethel.”</p>

<p>There was no way of retreat now that things had
gone so far. Besides, as George stood listening to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>the conversation of Ethel and Mrs. Minever he was
quickly devoured by a passion for further enlightenment.</p>

<p>“But do you mind telling me who you are?” he
heard Mrs. Minever say.</p>

<p>Elfreda gave her name. Any attempt at concealment
would have been useless. As the amazing story
was now by way of being public property the mistress
of the house had already guessed her visitor’s identity,
but the unsuspecting George was stupefied. In the
next moment, while his mind was still chaos, he awoke
to the fact that Lady Elfreda was gravely presenting
him to Mrs. Minever.</p>

<p>Poor George was staggered. He could but dimly
grasp the truth. Overcome by a sense of his own
inadequacy, he felt he was growing more and more
ridiculous. “But I don’t understand,” he said faintly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I must ask Lady Elfreda to explain,”
said Mrs. Minever with her color rapidly mounting,
with an odd tremor in her voice and with a rather
forced laugh.</p>

<p>“Please ask Miss Cass to enlighten you.” And Elfreda
cast a wicked glance at that ineffectual lady.</p>

<p>“Miss Cass!” Poor George seemed more bewildered
than ever.</p>

<p>“Ask her to tell you what has happened.” The
amazing Elfreda spoke with the slightly bored air of
one dismissing a tedious matter. And then, for all the
world as if it no longer existed for her, at Mrs. Minever’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
suggestion she turned calmly upon her heel and
accompanied that lady to the drawing room.</p>

<p>George Norris left alone with Miss Cass in the
agreeable vicinity of the good log fire made his halting
plea for further enlightenment. Girlie, stricken as she
was by the sense of her own guilt and the humiliation
of her own absurdity, had great difficulty in complying
with the request. Even upheld as she was now by
the arrival of Lady Elfreda, it still called for a mighty
effort to hold her tears in check.</p>

<p>Howbeit she was able to tell the incredible story
after a fashion. It was such a poor and halting
fashion, its lapses were so many that the unlucky
George had to fill in the gaps as well as he could. The
task was not easy for George’s naturally quick intelligence
did not serve him well in these trying moments.
But as with ever-growing dismay he really got the
hang of the story at last, he hardly knew whether to
laugh like a sportsman or to allow a sense of outrage
to consume him. For he himself, as he was not slow
to realize, had merely been fooled and put in a false
position like every one else.</p>

<p>He was able to muster a laugh, but the underside of
it was not mirth exactly. Over head and ears in love
with the wicked little witch he certainly was, but he saw
at once that all their plans were knocked awry. Laugh
as he might at the absolute success of the trick that
had been played, the cynicism and the arrogance which
deprived every one of any rights in such an affair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>could not be passed over. Even the most injudicious
of lovers must not omit that aspect of the case.</p>

<p>“But why&mdash;but why,” said the bewildered young
man, as he gazed in humorous horror at the tear-stained
Miss Cass, “why in the name of heaven did
you let her do it?”</p>

<p>“She made me,” was Girlie’s simple and pathetic
answer.</p>

<p>“Made you!” Like several other people he felt a
desire to shake this pretty little noodle. But a sense
of justice forced him to conclude that what she said
was true. Such a will as hers would be nought in
the scale with the implacable Elfreda’s. Recalling as
he now did each phase of that young woman’s career
of eleven days’ humorous devilment at The Laurels, he
was inclined to exonerate Miss Cass. There was but
one door where the blame could lie.</p>

<p>“The little devil!” George gave a sly whistle.
“And I suppose her father has gone to The Laurels to
fetch her?”</p>

<p>Girlie said that Lord Carabbas had.</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s the Lord Carabbas I remember”&mdash;George
burst into a sudden laugh&mdash;“she’ll have to
consider herself lucky if she doesn’t get a thoroughly
sound whipping.”</p>

<p>Girlie shuddered and turned pale. This display of
emotion was followed by silence. She herself had in
prospect a penalty even more severe. A stricken conscience
was causing her a great deal of pain. She felt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>that she deserved to suffer, and although it was good
to hear this young soldier laugh heartily at the whole
affair, there was something in his manner which implied
that privately he thought so too. Poor Girlie
had nothing of the picturesque aplomb of the culprit
in chief. Her sense of guilt was there for all to see.</p>

<p>As for George Norris, this remarkable conversation
with the real Miss Cass had suddenly made life
very difficult. His dream was shattered. For all his
merit as a soldier and the distinction he had won, he
was an extremely modest fellow. It was not for men
like himself to aspire to the Lady Elfreda Catkins of
the world, however much he might adore them.
Secretly he was full of resentment. Such mischievous
impudence was entirely amazing. He had a strong
desire to punish her, but with the perversity of a very
human being, her attraction for him was never so
great as now she stood revealed in all her wickedness.</p>

<p>Laugh he might, but the mirth of George Norris was
of the kind that seeks to cover a deep wound. He
was far more in love with this dainty rogue than was
either wise or desirable. But he had now to meet
the fact squarely that she was beyond his reach. True,
he could claim to be her accepted suitor, but circumstances
alter cases.</p>

<p>Yes, the case was altered. The only course now
was to pocket his pride along with the rest of his fine
feelings and return at once to The Laurels a sadly
humiliated man. The little wretch! How dare she?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>Once more he posed that futile question as he gazed at
the visibly wilting form of the real Miss Cass.</p>

<p>Even Lady Elfreda’s calm retirement to the drawing
room was an added impertinence. It was her way, no
doubt, of turning him down. She had fooled him, as
she had fooled every one else, to the utmost limit and
then cast him off like an old glove. Suddenly the decent
George began “to see red.” He would give a good
deal to get back a little of his own.</p>

<p>The longer George talked with Miss Cass the more
fully did he seem to realize that only one line of
conduct would now consort with his dignity. All the
same, it was not going to be easy to follow. To say
the least his position was very uncomfortable. The
immediate problem, as it seemed to him now, was
whether or no he should take a formal leave of Lady
Elfreda. Merely to say good-by or not to say good-by&mdash;which
course would best salve his damaged feelings?</p>

<p>He was still talking with Miss Cass and striving
vainly to get a just perception of his own relation to
such a set of exceptional circumstances when this problem
automatically solved itself. Lady Elfreda came
into the hall with an unknown gentleman.</p>

<p>George rose rather stiffly. “I think I’ll be going,”
he said lamely.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the scapegrace with cheerful promptitude.
“I want you to stay and meet my father. He
should soon be here now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>Such a charmingly easy acceptance of the situation
took George aback. “But will your father want to
meet me?” he said, fixing an eye sufficiently humorous
upon the unknown gentleman.</p>

<p>The unknown gentleman, a large and genial one,
was plainly threatened with a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“Lord Duckingfield, let me introduce General Norris,”
said the scapegrace coolly. Her air of taking
everything for granted struck Lord Duckingfield and
George Norris as exceedingly comic.</p>

<p>Bows were exchanged. Both men, however, maintained
an eloquent silence, although to judge by a certain
archness of look with which each regarded
the other it was clear that their minds spoke the same
language.</p>

<p>George, all the same, was suffering acutely from the
sense of his position. Even if he was over head and
ears in love with the little rogue, that was no reason
for courting a public humiliation. “I think I must
get back to The Laurels,” he said with all the firmness
he could muster. “Good-by, Lady Elfreda.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLII">XLII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">F</span>ate</span> was against George Norris.</p>

<p>Lady Elfreda persisted that he must stay and
meet her father. The unwisdom of such a course was
open and palpable, but he was a chivalrous fellow and,
in spite of the facer dealt him by her wicked trick, he
was still in the mood for adventure. Moreover, he
was simply devoured by curiosity as to what would
happen next.</p>

<p>For a man of average spirit it was worth running
a risk of personal insult to learn the next turn in
the game. What was to be the end of this amazing
comedy? That question lurked in the genial eye of
Lord Duckingfield. And the arch glance of that peer
seemed to tell George Norris that to beat a retreat at
such a moment would be conduct unworthy of a soldier,
a sportsman and the possessor of a sense of
humor.</p>

<p>Besides, to run away just now would be extremely
difficult. Not for the first time this charming little vixen
was pitting her will against his, not for the first time
was he experiencing its steel-like quality. There was
a heavy account to settle with her but she really was
delightful. And her “gameness” was magnificent.
“Of course, you’ll stay. You <i>must</i> meet The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>Dadda. He’s great fun.” The affectionate lisp might
have been inspired by a favorite golliwog.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll stay, General Norris.” A smiling but
anxious-looking hostess had appeared just in time to
enforce the appeal. “Have some tea, at any rate, before
you leave us.” Not wishing to show himself
a poltroon in the sight of the world General Norris
accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>In about five minutes tea was brought into the hall.
And then one by one the guests appeared from odd
corners of the house. They were hardly more than
a round half dozen, a company by no means formidable
either in number or in quality, but as the muster
grew, George for the first time in his life was afflicted
with a desire that the floor might open and swallow
him.</p>

<p>There was no reason, of course, why George Norris
should suffer this feeling. But he was a member of
the weaker sex. She, to whom such an emotion would
have been entirely appropriate, gave no sign of turning
a hair.</p>

<p>Upon the hostess devolved the task of making Lady
Elfreda known to those who might be said to be her
victims. It was performed heroically. One and all
might be sharing a mild sense of outrage, they might
be fuming inwardly at the arrogance of this chit who
was hardly out of her teens, but it was hard not to
admire her <i>sang-froid</i> in the presence of the enemy.</p>

<p>Really she was as unconcerned as if nothing had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>happened. She partook of some excellent tea and
some cake equally excellent with a zest that atoned for
a decidedly scratch luncheon at The Laurels. Poor
George, on the other hand, who had had no luncheon
at all was unable to peck a crumb. He had been four
years in France, his record was vouched for by the
row of decorations on his tunic, but at this moment
he was ready to own freely that here was the tightest
corner he had ever been in.</p>

<p>Everybody behaved beautifully, but it was soon
clear to George that one and all were looking forward
with huge enjoyment to the appearance of “The
Dadda” upon the scene. His return could not be long
delayed. And the miserable George was bound to deduce
from the suppressed tones and the sly looks all
about him that he had been cast for an important part
in the play.</p>

<p>Had George been as brave morally as he was in
the field he would have made a bolt for The Laurels
after his second cup of tea. Such publicity was altogether
too much. He felt these hard-bitten worldlings
were simply gloating over the possibilities of
the situation. Still, even in the extremity of stage
fright he was bound to remember that he had asked
this little girl to marry him and that she had consented
to do so. Of course, the preposterous circumstances
made the whole thing invalid, but as now he wrestled
with his moral weakness it came home to him that he
was very honestly in love with this minx. She was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>adorable. And as man is the being he is in the world
of the present, she was the more adorable because so
palpably out of his reach.</p>

<p>In point of time it was not very long and yet quite
long enough for the peace of mind of George Norris
before certain tokens heralded the return of Lord
Carabbas.</p>

<p>Perhaps the tidings were first promulgated by Hobson,
the butler, as he moved up to the front door. He
was an impassive fellow, but the look on his face
and the sight of him nervously crossing the hall
parquet seemed to demoralize more impressionable
members of the community. From Sir Toby Philpot
there arose a cry which resembled the shriek of a
plover. Nothing could check it except a violent attack
of coughing which intervened at the precise moment
that a lowering, heavy-jowled, empurpled face
suddenly projected itself from behind the large screen
of Chinese lacquer which shut off the cozy inner hall
from the outer darkness of the universe.</p>

<p>Apart from the muffled sound of Sir Toby’s attack
the silence was of the tomb. Lord Carabbas himself
stood speechless, glowering upon the company not unlike
a bull confronted by a red umbrella. Swiftly,
however, with a cry of charmed surprise, Lady Elfreda
rose from her place beside the hostess. “So here
you are, papa! You have been to The Laurels, I hear.
So sorry we missed you.”</p>

<p>As those tones of gay welcome rode the storm it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>was recognized at once that rumor had not over-painted
this young woman’s powers as an actress.
Montagu Jupp had been well within the mark when he
had said that their possessor was capable of playing all
the ingénues off the London stage. The intrepid coolness
with which she came forward to greet her parent
was sublime.</p>

<p>Lord Carabbas lowered his head a point as if about
to charge. For the moment, however, his animal energy
was confined to a few syncopated sounds in his
throat.</p>

<p>Not in the least abashed Lady Elfreda continued to
keep a firm hold on the situation.</p>

<p>“Let me introduce George Norris, papa.” It really
was sublime. For all the buzzing in his ears General
Norris was able to rise from his chair and bow with
solemnity.</p>

<p>Lord Carabbas did not return the bow. Indeed, if
the eyes of my lord had a meaning they simply affirmed
a desire to kill General Norris.</p>

<p>Tea was over, happily, and the spectators, although
fascinated by a scene more richly comic than any it
was their avowed business to create, did not allow
private considerations to balk a sense of sportsmanship.
It seemed only fair, at any rate, to a blameless
young soldier and an innocent peer, to give them
a chance. Mrs. Minever had the presence of mind
to lead the way to the drawing room. And the others
began silently, if in some cases reluctantly, to melt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>away. They would have given much to remain, but
decent people, after all, must sacrifice a little to the
manes of fair play.</p>

<p>In spite of her feeling that she had a prescriptive
right to be there, Girlie rose and followed in the wake
of the others. But a great effort of will was needed
in order to do so. And yet to stay in her nook, a
thrilled and guilty witness of the scene, would call
for more courage than she possessed.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand.” Those were the words
Girlie heard as she rose from her place by the fire.
The tone in which they were uttered was deep, stern,
menacing. Lord Carabbas, his voice trembling with
fury, looked first at Lady Elfreda and then at her
cavalier. “Perhaps you will explain.” The voice
tailed off so queerly that Girlie half expected Lord
Carabbas to hit General Norris a blow. Without
waiting for any such dreadful development she hurriedly
retired to King Edward’s bedroom.</p>

<p>So tense was the moment that George Norris
stepped back involuntarily, as if a blow was fully expected.</p>

<p>Elfreda, however, was magnificent.</p>

<p>“General Norris has asked me to marry him, papa,
and I should like to do so.” The precision of the
speech had a sort of astringent humor which somehow
had the effect of keeping “The Dadda” in hand. It
served to remind him that, in spite of the strain which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>had been cast upon him, it was his duty to remember
that beyond all things he was a gentleman.</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence in which it
seemed to George Norris that anything might happen,
and then Lord Carabbas, obviously making a tremendous
effort to keep calm, fixed the young man with
the eye of war and growled, “I don’t think I have the
pleasure of your acquaintance and yet I seem to know
your face.”</p>

<p>There was another long and tense moment. Involuntarily
George Norris stepped back another pace.
And then he said in that curiously frank manner which
Lady Elfreda liked so much, “Don’t you remember me,
sir? I am George Norris.”</p>

<p>“Norris&mdash;George Norris?” My lord’s brow was a
thundercloud. But that was merely the process of
thought. For the moment his memory had betrayed
him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, sir,” said the young man in his straightforward
fashion, “you will remember my father better
than you remember me.”</p>

<p>Lord Carabbas shook his head. Plainly he was still
at a loss.</p>

<p>“My father, sir, was butler for nearly thirty years
at Bally Euchra,” said General Norris modestly.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLIII">XLIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span> pin</span> might have been heard to fall on the hall
parquet. And then the voice of Lord Carabbas
rose to a bellow.</p>

<p>“What! Son of old Norris!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the modest George. But there was
a note in the voice of my lord that at once enabled
George Norris to assume perfect mastery over himself.
“And my father married Miss Hook, the maid
to your mother the Duchess.” With an air mildly
ironical the young man turned as he spoke to the girl
at his side.</p>

<p>Lady Elfreda was biting her lip sharply. She had
turned rather pale.</p>

<p>Another pin might have been heard to fall on the
hall parquet and then George Norris said very quietly
and calmly: “I should like you to understand, sir, that
when I asked Lady Elfreda to marry me I was under
the impression that she was a governess without a
situation, without money, without friends.”</p>

<p>Lord Carabbas nodded truculently. He was wise,
no doubt, not to trust himself with words.</p>

<p>“And, of course, you will understand, also, that
when Lady Elfreda did me the honor to accept my
offer she had no idea that I was the only son of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>grandfather’s late head butler and her grandmother’s
second&mdash;I believe it was second&mdash;maid.”</p>

<p>The young man ended this speech with a slight bow
for the benefit of Lady Elfreda. And then quite suddenly
he exploded in laughter. Lady Elfreda had the
wit to respond with a tempered outburst of her own.
But it lacked spontaneity. For all her power of will
she was obviously laughing now on the wrong side
of her mouth. As for Lord Carabbas, sore, bewildered,
seeking to fix a quarrel, he saw a new affront
in the method by which this son of old Norris chose
to handle a matter quite without precedent.</p>

<p>“I’m hanged if <i>I</i> can see anything to laugh at,” he
said.</p>

<p>Again Lord Carabbas stood looking from one to
the other of the culprits as if he would dearly like
to commit murder. But at this grim moment he was
saved from any rash or overt act by the composure of
his daughter and the manly commonsense of this son
of old Norris.</p>

<p>“I suppose, sir, I ought to apologize,” he said matter-of-factly,
“for landing you in this hocus. But, of
course, I hadn’t the least idea&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, that I quite see,” snapped Lord Carabbas.</p>

<p>“And of course it alters the case.”</p>

<p>Lord Carabbas saw that too. His nod, at any rate,
affirmed as much. And basking in a sense of acute
relief that the more pressing evil was in process of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>being removed, he suddenly remembered what was due
to this brilliant son of an old family retainer.</p>

<p>Recovering his air of grand seigneur, Lord Carabbas,
with as much heartiness as he could muster, congratulated
George Norris on his achievements in the
field. They did him great credit and his lordship was
quite sure that George’s parents, who had retired years
ago from the Duke’s service to the keeping of an hotel
near a golf links in County Down, a more lucrative if
less distinguished proposition, must be proud of their
son.</p>

<p>George modestly hoped that the old people were.
Lord Carabbas grew quite reassured. “By the way,”
he said, “were you ever in the Duke’s service? I seem
to remember you.”</p>

<p>“I was never really in the house, sir, except that
as a boy I did odd jobs; but at sixteen I contrived to
get into the estate office. You see, sir,” George
laughed, “I was always inclined to be ambitious.
There was an idea at the back of my mind that one
day I might become a land agent.”</p>

<p>Lord Carabbas nodded approvingly. “Now the war
is over I don’t know what your plans are, but I daresay
that something might be arranged.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, sir,” said George, “I have just
received the offer of a billet in British East Africa.
You see, I have decided to make the Army my profession.”</p>

<p>Again Lord Carabbas nodded approvingly. Such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>a career sounded almost as attractive as the offer of a
stool in the Bally Euchra Estate Office. Still, the
civilian career might be the less precarious. Anyhow,
Lord Carabbas would be pleased to do what he could
in the matter if the son of old Norris cared to consider
the project.</p>

<p>George thanked Lord Carabbas. Thereupon that
peer congratulated him upon his success, hoped that
whatever course he took would prove to be the right
one and shook him gravely but cordially by the hand.
Having thus disposed of one whom he was bound to
regard as his protégé, my lord went up to his room
and proceeded resolutely to compose his ruffled feelings
in a mustard bath.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLIV">XLIV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> now remained for George Norris the task
of taking a final leave of the lady of his choice.
Recent developments should have made the task easy,
but when it came to the point he found it supremely
difficult.</p>

<p>While The Dadda was still in the act of ascending
the stairs George offered the hand of farewell. “Good-by,
Lady Elfreda.” This trying business was like a
chemist’s draught; let it be attacked at once and got
over quickly.</p>

<p>Lady Elfreda, however, had to be consulted in the
matter of pace and even in the mode of procedure.
Completely ignoring the hand of farewell she asked
calmly with that leisureliness which was at times so
exasperating, “When do you start for East Africa?”</p>

<p>“I am going up to town to-morrow,” said George,
“to see them at the War Office. I’m hoping to get out
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be very jolly if you do.” She looked at him
with the odd directness which sometimes was so delightful
and sometimes so disconcerting.</p>

<p>Her manner gave no hint of the gulf that had opened
between them. He was troubled exceedingly. Educated
by the usage of a hard world he was not unduly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>sensitive or inclined to take himself too seriously, but
still he was not proof altogether against a feeling of
resentment. He had been so properly fooled that her
air of unconcern seemed an added impertinence. Still,
it was no use mounting the high horse. He must grin
and bear the blow. Perhaps the process would be a
little easier for the fact that in his own mind he was
quite sure he didn’t really deserve it.</p>

<p>George was still trying to make a final exit without
loss of dignity and Lady Elfreda in a subtle way
seemed to be trying her utmost to compromise it still
further when Mrs. Minever arrived from the drawing
room. The young man was at such a serious disadvantage
that he was ready to welcome the lady of the
house as an agent of providence. But she, it seemed,
was not so much prepared to offer a means of escape
as to fix still further the shackles of embarrassment
upon him. She hoped General Norris would stay to
dinner.</p>

<p>Nothing was further from the wish or the intention
of General Norris, but for a reason only known
to herself, Mrs. Minever was not at all inclined to take
a polite refusal. “The Laurels is on the telephone.
It will be easy to let them know&mdash;unless you have some
particular engagement? And the car shall take you
there afterwards.”</p>

<p>The urgency of Mrs. Minever backed by the dynamic
glance of the enchantingly wicked Elfreda made it very
difficult for George Norris to be firm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>
<p>“But my clothes,” he said rather weakly, to end a
pause which he felt was undoing him.</p>

<p>Really, it was the feeblest of moves. The yellow
chrysanthemum lady merely cast a glance at the displays
of ribands peeping shyly from beneath his open
overcoat. “I hope,” she said archly, “the King’s
uniform will always be good enough for us.”</p>

<p>George saw he was done. The light in the eye of
the wicked Elfreda told him so. Evidently some new
game was in the wind&mdash;but in for a penny, in for a
pound! It was a moment for philosophy. Besides, a
natural appetite for adventure had been enormously
whetted by the amazing events of the past three hours.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. With a reluctance which
in the depths of his heart George Norris knew to be
not wholly sincere he allowed Mrs. Minever to lead
him to the telephone.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLV">XLV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">G</span>irlie</span>, in the meantime, had gone to ground
in King Edward’s bedroom. The public eye
was no place for her. All she asked now, if so much
was permitted her, was to retire permanently into
private life. She even cherished the modest hope that
she might be allowed to make her escape from that
house by the first train in the morning.</p>

<p>Shivering at her thoughts over the recently lighted
bedroom fire, her faith was still pinned upon Lady
Elfreda. It was a much-tired, a sorely-shattered
faith, but it was now her only stand-by. The task
would devolve upon Lady Elfreda of convincing Mrs.
Minever and the others that her Deputy was really not
“an adventuress” at all, or any kind of criminal in disguise,
but the well educated daughter of a solicitor,
who, no matter what her folly, was quite incapable of
theft.</p>

<p>It was a horrid position for a budding Charlotte
Brontë to occupy. As she viewed in perspective the
eleven epic days she had contrived to live through since
leaving London she could but marvel at herself. Oh,
why had she ever embarked on this maddest of
schemes! Her place was lost, her character was lost,
she had used abominably a man who had gained her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>admiration and respect, whom she would have found
it very easy to love. Never again could she hold up
her head, not even if Lady Elfreda was able to satisfy
the police that her Deputy was a reasonably innocent
member of society!</p>

<p>Shivering over the logs as they spluttered to a reluctant
heat, Girlie had never felt so low and miserable
in her life. Remorse was whipping her severely.
Ruin stared her in the face. Whatever would become
of her! A hopeless future loomed ahead. No ray of
hope was visible. Her mad enterprise had ended in
the only way it could have done.</p>

<p>Soon after the clock had struck seven Girlie, fathoms
deep in gloom, was startled by the entrance of Lady
Elfreda. By now the poor Deputy had begun to feel
a profound dislike of this cynical girl who had involved
her in ruin. Howbeit, she still found it difficult not to
admire her. Such assurance, such decision, such competence,
such spirit were marvelous. She seemed to
have every attribute of a She Napoleon.</p>

<p>“Where’s that stupid old Pikey?” she said. In her
manner of pressing the bell Girlie felt there was something
magnificent. “She ought to be here rooting me
out some clothes for this evening.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Girlie dismally, yet heroically suppressing
her tears, “I must leave this room now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” There was a regal indifference to the
room even if it was King Edward’s. “There’s one
next door will do for me. But I must have something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>to put on this evening.” She pressed the bell again
just as Pikey entered, half truculent, half scared.</p>

<p>Girlie was still in awe of the Werewolf. Even the
partial collapse of Pikey under the stress of events did
not allow the Deputy to get on terms with her. But
Elfreda’s method of handling the creature was almost
an education. In the sight of her lawful charge she
counted for rather less than nobody.</p>

<p>“Pikey, what am I to wear this evening?” At the
moment this was the question of questions for Elfreda.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing you can wear,” Pikey muttered dismally.</p>

<p>“Nothing? Don’t be absurd. I know you packed
at least five evening dresses.”</p>

<p>Pikey flashed a savage glance at Miss Cass.</p>

<p>“<i>She’s</i> worn them all,” said Pikey in a tone of
shameful confession.</p>

<p>“Of course. Why not?” said a very polite and very
prompt Elfreda. No one likes other people wearing
one’s clothes, but Pikey’s implication that their patrician
owner would never be able to use them again was
a little too much. It was one more barb for Miss No-Class.</p>

<p>Elfreda, however, with a woman’s understanding of
the case did her best to soften it. She was the soul
of tact and she was quite charming to Miss Cass.</p>

<p>“Please choose the one you like best for this evening.”
Her winning grace brought back to poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>Girlie’s mind their never-to-be-forgotten journey from
London.</p>

<p>Girlie declined the offer with tears.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I c-couldn’t think of going down to dinner this
evening,” she said with a little shiver.</p>

<p>“But, of course, you are going down to dinner.”
Napoleon&mdash;Hannibal&mdash;Etc.; the sinister cycle of their
first meeting was being enacted again.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I couldn’t&mdash;I really couldn’t&mdash;I could never
face them all!”</p>

<p>“But of course you will.” Each slow syllable of
the Evil Genius seemed to burn itself in Girlie’s heart.
“If you don’t play up now you will spoil everything.”</p>

<p>Girlie shuddered. She fought against her tears.
“I&mdash;I am ruined and disgraced. I&mdash;I don’t know
whatever will become of me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t either,” Elfreda grimly agreed, “if you
let go now.”</p>

<p>With the power of will that made her so formidable
Elfreda ordered Pikey to lay out Madame Lucile’s
new pink dress for Miss Cass.</p>

<p>“That is the one I think. It goes perfectly with
your coloring. You must let Pikey do your hair.
And you shall have my nicest necklace.”</p>

<p>At the word “necklace” Girlie shuddered again.
The prison gates loomed before her eyes.</p>

<p>“And you shall have my new Pinet slippers if they’ll
fit you. Now do be sensible. This evening you must
simply play up for all you are worth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>It was all very well, but nature has set a limit to
what flesh and blood can endure. Stage fright had
once more fixed its talons on Girlie. “Oh, no, I can’t
face them to-night,” she said miserably.</p>

<p>She was reckoning, however, without the dæmonic
force that encompassed her. Its power over weak vessels
was truly remarkable. And among these Pikey
was foremost. The Werewolf, after all, was no more
than a lath painted to look like iron and none knew
that quite so well as her mistress. She ordered the
disgruntled old woman about with the genial arrogance
she might have bestowed on a favorite dog. And
Pikey, mumbling under her breath, was only too ready
to do her bidding</p>

<p>As for Miss Cass, she found herself in the midst
of her toilet before she could quite realize what was
taking place. Elfreda superintended it. “Yes, the
pink one, Pikey. And those stockings, I think.”</p>

<p>As ever, she was curiously impersonal but her taste
was sure, she could bring her mind down to details
and it was inflexible. Miss Cass was clay in her
hands. Yet even now there was just one matter in
which the unfortunate Deputy was able to muster a
mind of her own. She insisted that no alien fingers
should touch her hair.</p>

<p>“Better let Pikey, hadn’t you? She’s used to hair.
She’s really rather clever with it.”</p>

<p>Here it was, however, that Miss Cass made her
stand. She took the terrible, long-handled brush
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>gently but firmly from Pikey’s grasp. “I am used
to doing it myself&mdash;I am really.”</p>

<p>Pikey’s sniff of disdain confirmed that statement.
Elfreda was loth to yield the point, but time was fleeting.
And Miss Cass, hairbrush in hand, was displaying
such skill that it seemed vain to contest it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better come and give me a hand,
Pikey.”</p>

<p>With a devout sense of thankfulness Girlie watched
mistress and maid retire to the room next door.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLVI">XLVI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> Elfreda returned about half an hour later
she was dressed for the evening. Girlie was
thrilled by the picture of charm and fascination that
she made. If not exactly pretty, she had a highly
finished daintiness and beyond everything the strength
of personality which transcends physical beauty yet
is in itself a form of beauty. Somehow the sight of
Elfreda cap-à-pie, bright, strong and audacious meant
a great deal to her fellow conspirator.</p>

<p>“Now please remember,” said the Evil Genius with
that impersonal air which seemed to add to her power,
“you simply <i>must</i> play up.”</p>

<p>Poor Girlie had no spirit left in her. So black was
the future that it was mere mockery to speak of “playing
up.” Besides, where was the necessity now?</p>

<p>Elfreda looked her up and down with an eye of frank
but not unkindly criticism.</p>

<p>“Don’t let go, whatever you do&mdash;for your own sake.
Your dress is most becoming.” She really <i>was</i> pretty.
Madame Lucile’s latest creation might have been made
for her. And the forlorn look in her tear-dimmed
eyes was an added weapon ... if the little noodle
only knew how to use it!</p>

<p>Elfreda led the way along the corridor and downstairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
to the drawing room. There seemed to be a
buzz of suppressed excitement as they came in. Most
of the others were already there. They did not want
to miss a moment of the comedy. All might be said
to be on tiptoe to learn the next turn in the game.</p>

<p>Girlie would dearly have liked to sink through the
floor, yet she was sustained by the imperious power
which still enslaved her. And before dinner was announced
an event occurred which did much to lessen
the painful tension of the Deputy. In fact it appeared
to have an immediate effect upon everybody. Mrs.
Minever pointed to an article which enclosed the third
finger of her left hand and said with a rather forced
laugh, “Behold, the missing ring!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’ve found it, Kate,”
cried her lord.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Mrs. Minever had. It seemed that
the precious ring had merely been mislaid. She was
willing to take the whole of the blame upon herself,
although it should really belong to a stupid and forgetful
servant.</p>

<p>“Well, I call that the limit!”</p>

<p>Mr. Minever was not alone in so regarding the incident.
A deep growl of humorous disgust slowly
permeated the room. “There now, didn’t I say that
man from Scotland Yard was a perfect fool!”</p>

<p>A shout of laughter greeted the indignant words of
Lord Duckingfield. It was freely owned that the
worthy Midlander had said so from the first. He had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>stood alone in his defense of the little governess. His
sportsmanship had been admired, if skeptics deplored
his gullibility. And now at this dramatic moment,
like the big-hearted man he was, he contrived to underscore
this admirable quality. For as the hostess and
Lord Carabbas led the way to the dinner table, he
moved across to Girlie, bowed to her and offered his
arm.</p>

<p>It was a very hilarious meal. Everybody realized
that they were on their honor “to play up,” There
could be no middle course. In the eyes of the fastidious
these people might be vulgar, they might be second-rate,
yet they were fully entitled to plume themselves
on their sportsmanship.</p>

<p>Certainly an excellent dinner blended with their high
spirits enabled them to carry the thing off brilliantly.
Even Lord Carabbas, feeling his reputation as a sportsman
to be at stake, made quite a brave showing. He
still cherished homicidal feelings towards his youngest
daughter, but the character of the food, the quality of
the wine, the chaff and the gayety helped him to keep
them well in hand. It was a dickens of a business,
but he must “stick it” to the bitter end.</p>

<p>By one of those odd strokes of fortune which seem
so inconsequent and yet obey the laws of reason, Miss
Cass suddenly became the heroine of the hour. Everybody
seemed thankful that an undeserved stigma had
been removed; besides, the only means of punishing the
culprit-in-chief was to canonize the understudy. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>patrician impudence of Lady Elfreda could not be forgiven.
It went so deep that it could only be wiped
out with blood. Meanwhile, it had to be suffered and
this was best achieved by absolving Miss Cass and
even making much of her.</p>

<p>Perhaps for that reason General Norris, an undoubted
figure of romance, was not acclaimed as the
hero. The proud position was reserved for Sir Toby
Philpot or with more accuracy it might be said that
Sir Toby reserved it for himself. The little baronet
had all the airs of a Congreve or a Sheridan with a
dash of Molière thrown in. Superior people who had
said “The Lady of Laxton” was far-fetched or impossible
had been refuted wonderfully by what had
occurred. The series of situations he had devised
for his masterpiece had been outdone by these amazing
events.</p>

<p>What a consolation it is that no matter what
absurdities imagination may bring forth, Real Life
never has any difficulty in going one better!</p>

<p>Odd as the circumstances were, there was not a suspicion
of constraint. Mr. Montagu Jupp saw to that.
As a matter of course he presided over the revels. His
badinage rolled from one end of the table to the other,
his wit vollied unceasingly. True to himself, in as
rare a moment as life had given him, he spared neither
age nor sex nor social position. Even an enraged
parent finding a most excellent dinner to be a real
stimulus to a sense of humor could not resist Montagu’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
audacity. It was not so much what he said, it
was the way in which he said it. Nevertheless, the
great man’s words were exceedingly to the point.</p>

<p>What, for example, could have been more apposite
than the impromptu speech in which he proposed the
health of Lord Duckingfield? He rose at a moment
when a lull was threatening and in terms which set
the table in a roar he offered that peer sincere felicitations
on his approaching marriage. Moreover, he
ventured to link with the toast the name of their friend
Miss Cass.</p>

<p>The toast was honored with acclamation. No doubt
the acclamation was the louder for the fact that these
primitive people were fully aware that for once even
the admired Montagu had sailed rather close to the
wind. There was a moment when the success of the
<i>ballon d’essai</i> hung in the balance. In this world there
is a limit to most things, after all!</p>

<p>For the brief space of thirty seconds the look on
the face of the worthy Midlander seemed to promise
an early delivery of the long-delayed punch on Montagu’s
nose. It was nearly fifty years since he had last
received one at his private school. But as the sequel
proved, Montagu’s wonderful faculty of divination
had judged to a nicety the thickness of the ice.</p>

<p>Lord Duckingfield rose slowly and heavily to his
feet and thanked the company for their kind words.
He thanked them not only on his own behalf, but&mdash;turning
to the bewildered little girl at his side with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>the most courtly bow he could command&mdash;also on
behalf of the lady who he hoped would do him the
honor to become his wife.</p>

<p>The effect of the announcement may have been a
trifle marred by a loud shriek from the little baronet.
Stimulated by Sir Toby’s threat of hysteria, Mr. Jupp
broke suddenly into “For he’s a jolly good fellow.”
The strain was promptly taken up and musical honors
were bestowed upon my lord.</p>

<p>In the meantime the bewildered Girlie was passing
through a sort of dream. She could not believe her
ears. At any rate, she could not believe the words
of Lord Duckingfield. She was really in love with
this good fellow. It was not merely that he alone
could stand between her and a cruel world, it was not
merely that he was her only protector; she loved him
for his manliness, his generosity, his large simplicity.
But a girl like herself could never hope to be his wife,
particularly after having made of him a public laughing
stock.</p>

<p>Still it is the unexpected that happens. An hour
later, in the lee of the hall stairs, Lord Duckingfield
was able to prove to Girlie Cass that he fully intended
to be as good as his word.</p>

<p>About the same time, in the seclusion of the library,
Elfreda took pains to prove to George Norris that she
also was determined to keep faith with him. A stormy
interview with her father did something to nerve her
for the task. But, in any case, her mind was made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>up. Her year in London with the V. A. D. had opened
her eyes to the world and the things around her. She
saw a chance of permanent escape from the stuffy circle
in which she had been brought up. Her pompous,
caste-ridden parents, her narrow, conventional sisters&mdash;what
did they stand for, after all?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XLVII">XLVII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>rigadier General Norris, C.M.G</span>., and
Lady Elfreda Norris proceeded to East Africa at
the end of January. The climate suits them, they get
on well with the natives and they like the life immensely.
So far there is not a cloud on their horizon.
Just at first General Norris was a trifle anxious about
money, because the daughter of even an impoverished
marquis is apt to think expensively. But early in
March Grandpapa Angora died at the ripe age of
eighty-seven and the old gentleman really “cut up”
better than most people expected. Anyhow, when the
will was proved each of his grandchildren benefited to
the tune of thirty thousand pounds. Moreover, in the
year 1916, George Norris, or Captain Norris as he was
then, on the advice of a friend in the City invested
the whole of his savings in Burmah Oil, and like
a wise young man forgot all about the matter for several
years. So you see, there’s really no need for the
young couple to worry about money.</p>

<p>However, these are mundane matters. What is
vastly more important is that the Lady Elfreda
Norris has already presented to the Empire a sturdy
young male. And if the printers come out again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>on strike, before this work sees the light she is quite
likely to have presented it with another one.</p>

<p>It is very doubtful if Lady Duckingfield will ever
be a Miss Cholmondeley or a Mrs. Humphry Ward.
Charlotte Brontë is out of the question. 4b Berkeley
Square and Mount Pleasant, Wolverhampton, are
really so comfortable that all thought of “sturm und
drang” has passed for ever. And no one can be a
Charlotte Brontë without it. Still, Lady Duckingfield
is not quite dead to ambition. The <i>Saturday
Sentinel</i> paid her such charming compliments on her
essay, “The Art of Mr. Galsworthy,” that she has
in contemplation critical estimates of other modern
novelists. Her next subject will be...?</p>

<p>No, please guess again....</p>

<p>However.</p>

<p>There is no moral to this story. Life itself has
no moral. The most deserving people don’t always
come out “on top.” And vice versa.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
